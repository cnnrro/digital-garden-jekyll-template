# How do you want to live?

This is the question that comes after "Why do I exist?" and "What's the meaning of life?"

Even if those two have no answers, the fact is we're still here---and it's up to us to make the most of it.

## How to be more intentional

My goal is to stop living life on autopilot. To lead a life with more intention. To be more deliberate with my time.

I want to spend every day learning. And I want to share those experiences here.

If any of this sounds interesting, check out [my blog](https://www.connorjrobbins.com/blog/) or find me on [twitter](https://twitter.com/connorjrobbins).

If you want a little more I have a [newsletter](https://tinyletter.com/connorjrobbins) that's sent out every other Sunday. (You can also read the [newsletter archive](https://tinyletter.com/connorjrobbins/archive) if you're interested.)
