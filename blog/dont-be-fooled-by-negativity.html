Our brains love negativity<a href=#i-our-brains-love-negativity class=anchor aria-hidden=true>§</a></h2><p>How often do you find yourself seeking out and engaging with content that will inspire you, uplift you, or otherwise leave you feeling better than you did before?<p><strong>How often do you find yourself doom-scrolling?</strong><p>Next time you’re scrolling through the news, or social media, take a second to examine what content catches your attention the most.<p><em>Chances are it won’t be the uplifting posts.</em><p>By default, most people are pre-disposed to engage with negative content. It’s a quirk of the human brain.<p>There’s a reason people love to bond over shared hatred towards a tv show, politician, or idea.<p><em>There’s a reason we spend so much time obsessing over everything wrong with this world.</em><h2 id=ii-creators-know-this>II. Creators know this…<a href=#ii-creators-know-this class=anchor aria-hidden=true>§</a></h2><p>and everyone else is left picking up the bill.<p>If you investigate the art and science of copywriting, or more generally, content creation and growth/engagement strategies, chances are you’ll come across this advice: <strong>Use negative emotions to your advantage.</strong><p>Whether it’s advertisements reminding you of what you don’t have, news outlets re-framing events to their most negative form, or content creators focusing on things they hate rather than what they love—<u>negativity works.</u><p>As a quick experiment which of these two statements causes a more visceral reaction in you:<ol><li>The one habit all billionaires share.<li>Don’t have this one habit? Enjoy being poor…</ol><p>It’s easy to get attention if you employ this method. But at what cost?<p>The best marketers understand this power, and <em>the least ethical employ it liberally.</em><h2 id=iii-but-you-still-have-a-choice>III. But you still have a choice<a href=#iii-but-you-still-have-a-choice class=anchor aria-hidden=true>§</a></h2><p>While algorithms, ads, and marketers may often decide what gets placed in front of our eyes, we still have the choice of what to engage in.<p><strong>If attention is currency, we have the choice of where to spend it.</strong><p><em>You</em> decide what posts you like, telling the algorithm what you want to see more of. <em>You</em> get to decide whether to spend time reading the replies to a news story that distresses you. <em>You</em> can turn it all off and pick up a good book.<p>No matter the narrative others try to push, <em>you</em> have a choice.<h2 id=iv-is-it-worth-it>IV. Is it worth it?<a href=#iv-is-it-worth-it class=anchor aria-hidden=true>§</a></h2><p>If we have a choice of what to engage with, how do we make the determination?<p>Take account of the content you consume.<p>Next time you’re going to scroll through Twitter, note down how you feel before and after.<p>Do you feel better, or worse? More informed, or more confused? Optimistic, or pessimistic?<p>The content you consume should be working for you. It should improve your life, not be a drain on it.<p><strong>A little reflection and curation will do wonders.</strong><h2 id=v-isnt-it-sometimes-worth-it>V. Isn’t it sometimes worth it?<a href=#v-isnt-it-sometimes-worth-it class=anchor aria-hidden=true>§</a></h2><p>I don’t mean to discourage staying up-to-date on world events or gaining a better understanding of our fellow man.<p>Sometimes deeply negative things deserve our attention and our understanding.<p><em>But, be intentional about your education.</em><p>Often, negative emotions can be a catalyst for change. Either internally, or in a grander sense.<p>This is most certainly a good thing.<p>But understand the cost associated with it. Your well-being has value. Ask yourself: “What is this costing me, and what am I and the world getting out of it?”<p>If you’re going to invest your time, your happiness, and your well-being in something, it better be worth it.<h2 id=vi-do-what-you-can>VI. Do what you can<a href=#vi-do-what-you-can class=anchor aria-hidden=true>§</a></h2><p>Sometimes it’s worth investing time and energy in something negative if it will inform our perspective or improve the world.<p>For example, understanding social injustices, and climate change, is probably worth your time and energy.<p><em>But, you can be more intentional about it.</em><p>If you want to be informed on a topic, is scrolling the endless negative replies to a news story the best way to achieve that goal?<p>Chances are you’d be better off reading a book or two on the topic. It’ll be far less emotionally charged, and far more informative.<p>If you want to make an impact—change the world—is dedicating several hours a day to doom-scrolling and feeling bad the best way to achieve that goal?<p>Research what steps you can take, and which organizations you can support to make a meaningful change, and close the tweet that does nothing other than drain your optimism.<h2 id=vii-leave-the-rest>VII. Leave the rest<a href=#vii-leave-the-rest class=anchor aria-hidden=true>§</a></h2><p>Finally, understand your limitations.<p>There are only so many hours in a day, and there is only so much of yourself emotionally for you to give.<p><em>We can’t know everything, and we can’t fix everything.</em><p><strong>What are you willing and able to commit to?</strong><p>There is no sense in spending hours a day feeling terrible about American politics when you’re a citizen of Ireland. Find an action you can take, find a meaningful way to get informed, and leave the rest.<p>For any given topic, effectively understand the issue at hand, and decide if you’re able to make a positive change.<p><em>Act, or let it go.</em><p>There is no sense in allowing these things to pollute your mind when you cannot impact them or aren’t committed to acting.<p>Otherwise, you’ll be investing your well-being for nothing.<hr><h2 id=viii-final>VIII. Final<a href=#viii-final class=anchor aria-hidden=true>§</a></h2><p>There exists an emotional asymmetry in the attention economy.<p>Content creators can alter the minds of millions, and many are doing so with no real focus on the ethics of their actions.<p>Recognize when others are playing on your attention with negative emotions.<p>There can be a strange king of glee in negativity. Don’t fall for it.<p>It’s insidious.<p>It may feel fulfilling for a moment, but it will slowly erode the light inside you.<p><strong><em>Be intentional with your attention.</em></strong></article></div></main></div></article><h3>Recent posts</h3><div><div class=list-entry><div><a href=/blog/getting-out-of-a-rut>Getting out of a Rut</a> <span class=faded>(2021-09-04)</span></div><div>The method I use to get back on course.</div></div><div class=list-entry><div><a href=/blog/stillness>Stillness</a> <span class=faded>(2021-08-28)</span></div><div>My mind was empty.
