But I mean portfolio in a more general sense of the word. Any body of publicly available work can be considered a portfolio.<p>If you’re a data scientist it may be some models you’ve created and the analysis write-up that goes along with it. If you’re a writer it may be some flash fiction or articles you’ve written. Even someone as unlikely to have a portfolio as an accountant may publish their thoughts on how IFRS will impact the particular industry they’re most expert at.<p>No matter what your career, by-work, or passions may be, I am certain there is a way you can compile some records that act as a publicly available portfolio. (Or at the very least, a portfolio you’ll be able to show on request.)<p>If this concept in general interests you, I would recommend checking out <a href=https://perell.com/ target=_blank rel=external>David Perell</a> who is a known proponent of writing as a means of career development.<p>Here are some reasons why, regardless of who you are, you should have a portfolio.<h2 id=i-the-immediate-value-of-starting>I. The immediate value of starting<a href=#i-the-immediate-value-of-starting class=anchor aria-hidden=true>§</a></h2><p>Starting something isn’t hard. And yet most people never do it.<p>You can go from having zero online presence to having a blog online in less than 20 minutes and for no money down. And yet, there is a large group of people who say “someday I’ll sit down and start that blog.”<p>Again, for most things, starting isn’t hard.<p><em>And yet, most people never start.</em><p>This means if you do start it’s an immediate signal.<p>Doing work that wasn’t asked of you is an indication others cannot ignore.<p>Once you’ve begun, even if you feel you haven’t yet achieved anything, the mere act of starting is a major indicator for others.<p>Don’t believe me? Imagine for a moment that you’re a relatively successful musician and you open up Twitter to see these two DMs.<blockquote><p>“Hey, <strong>I have a podcast</strong> where every week we interview a new musician in the NYC area. We’d love to have you on. Are you available to chat next Tuesday at …”</blockquote><blockquote><p>“Hey, <strong>I’m planning on starting a podcast</strong> in the next 6 months where we interview a new musician in the …”</blockquote><p>Which of those two is going to get a response?<p>(Or, at the very least, merit further investigation.)<h2 id=ii-be-prepared>II. Be prepared<a href=#ii-be-prepared class=anchor aria-hidden=true>§</a></h2><p>A screenwriter friend of mine once talked himself into a party. Soon enough he was rubbing elbows with some big shots and eventually he was engaged in a conversation with the head of a major network.<p>He had done it.<p>He had done what most screenwriters only ever hope to achieve. Here he was talking to someone that had the money, and the decision making ability, to turn a script into a movie.<p>And so this exec asked him “Do you have anything I could read?”<p>…<p><em>He hadn’t finished a script.</em><p>The only thing worse than being caught red-handed is being caught empty-handed.<p>We often spend so much time focusing on how to optimize our path to success that we forget one minor detail: Doing the work.<p>Having a portfolio enforces that detail. To have a portfolio, you need to have done the work to bring it into existence.<p>It’s obvious, but if you plan to network, if you plan to make partnerships, then it’s in your best interest to <em>be prepared.</em><p>As <a href=https://twitter.com/shl target=_blank rel=external>Sahil</a> would say:<blockquote><p>Let your work network for you, then let your network work for you.</blockquote><p>Next time you find yourself in the same room as someone that can help take you to the next level, <em>make sure you have a script they can read.</em></article></div></main></div></article><h3>Recent posts</h3><div><div class=list-entry><div><a href=/blog/keep-a-journal>Keep a Journal</a> <span class=faded>(2021-07-24)</span></div><div>We are all artists, our lives our masterpieces.
