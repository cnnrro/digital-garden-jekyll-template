Eventually I picked one that fit all my possible eventual needs, but required extensive customization. After all this work I was so exhausted that I gave up.<p>The second time I started writing online I decided I wouldn’t make the same mistake, instead I would just write the entire thing from scratch. You can imagine how this ended up. (Note: I did end up publishing my site online, and I’m still very proud of that work, however, it did not get me into the habit of publishing often.)<p>The third time I started writing, and hopefully the last, I went with a pre-existing platform because I knew it would be good enough to start doing the <em>real work</em>—that is, to start publishing often.<p>All this to say I, like many, have a bad habit of the <em>depth first search.</em> Before we can feel comfortable taking the first step, we need to be certain that it’ll be the first step of the optimal approach.<p>This is not only ridiculous, it gets in your way.<p>I’ve had to learn this lesson over and over, but each time it gets a little easier and I catch myself a little quicker. Now when starting a project I try to ask myself “What is the <em>true purpose?</em> What am I trying to develop?”<p>Now, if your purpose is to learn about html, css, seo, open graph markup, etc. Then writing something from scratch might be the right approach. But, if your purpose is to <strong>publish writing online</strong> then all of that additional work only serves to distract.<p>In this specific case the easy way out—going with a system I don’t need to think about—is what empowers me to do the real work.<p>The advice I would give myself:<ul><li>Start now<li>Start simply<li>Focus on the meaningful work<li>Ignore everything else</ul><p>Or, otherwise put, “take the easy way out.”</article></div></main></div></article><h3>Recent posts</h3><div><div class=list-entry><div><a href=/blog/stillness>Stillness</a> <span class=faded>(2021-08-28)</span></div><div>My mind was empty.
