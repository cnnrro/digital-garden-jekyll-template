In any given week, I spend a significant portion of time collecting thoughts, writing them out, editing them to the bone, and publishing them.<p>This is time I could be spending on anything—time that I will never get back.<p><em>Why do it?</em><h2 id=i-clarity-of-thinking>I. Clarity of thinking<a href=#i-clarity-of-thinking class=anchor aria-hidden=true>§</a></h2><p>How vivid are your ideas?<p>Are they vivid, or is their purity fooling you into believing they’re more composed than they really are?<p>It’s easy to fool yourself when you haven’t written something down—to believe you know something when you don’t.<p>When our ideas are left in our minds, whether they’re theories of life, plans for the future, or reflections on an argument we had a year ago, they tend to appear perfect. Before we communicate an idea, whether through composition on the page or speaking to a friend, it’s as if our mind is holding only the platonic ideal of the idea.<p>The idea represents itself as a perfect sphere, an abstract ideal that only when described in physical reality—when brought to life—will show its imperfections.<p>To clarify, <em>those imperfections were always there.</em> But only through the communication of the abstract idea into reality will you be able to observe them.<p>And only once you’ve observed the imperfections can you begin to improve upon them.<h2 id=ii-my-past-self>II. My past self<a href=#ii-my-past-self class=anchor aria-hidden=true>§</a></h2><p>Often I write as if I were speaking to, or put more accurately, pleading with my past self.<p>While I’m happy with my life, I’ve made my fair share of mistakes in life, and writing helps to address and learn from these mistakes.<p>Reflection through writing can help put the past to rest and help one grow from their regrets. Not to mention, if what I write can help even one kindred spirit avoid my mistakes, it’ll all have been worth it.<p>Putting my thoughts to page enforces advice that I would be willing to give to others—and reminds me to take it myself.<h2 id=iii-in-short>III. In short<a href=#iii-in-short class=anchor aria-hidden=true>§</a></h2><p>I believe that to live an intentional life, you must be self-reflective.<p>And I find writing to be the deepest form of reflection possible.</article></div></main></div></article><h3>Recent posts</h3><div><div class=list-entry><div><a href=/blog/perennial-regret>Perennial Regret</a> <span class=faded>(2021-08-07)</span></div><div>If we are growing, regret is destined to be present for all seasons of our lives.
