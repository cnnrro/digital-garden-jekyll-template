Okay, *I lied to you with that subject line.*

But if that subject line convinced you to open this email, then <u>you're the exact person that needs to read this.</u>

Yesterday I posted [Don't Be Fooled by Negativity](https://www.connorjrobbins.com/blog/dont-be-fooled-by-negativity?utm_source=newsletter&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=2021-06-06). It's a piece about how negativity is used to garner attention, and what we can do to fight against it as an individual.

If you've ever found yourself doom-scrolling or closed a social media app feeling worse than when you opened it, you should give it a read.

Our time is incredibly precious, but often overlooked is our emotional capacity.

Our emotional well-being is foundational to our living, and these days, well-being is often in short supply.

Negativity physically drains us, and the impact can be felt in every aspect of our life.

With this in mind, we must be intentional about our attention. To avoid doom-scrolling, we must understand it. And if we want to inform ourselves, and make an impact, we need to be deliberate in our actions.

We don't need to live under a rock to be happy, but we do need to take responsibility for our attention and make an effort to improve our consumption.
