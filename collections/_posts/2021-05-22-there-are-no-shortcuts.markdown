Do the work.

<u>There is no substitute.</u>

Many are told, "work smarter not harder," and from this seek shortcuts where there are none. They avoid the *work* by focusing on the *process.* They try to find the most effective way to do what they hope while making no progress.

While they try to discover the most effective way to run a race, others continue to lap them.

(And those others learn to speed up with every lap they complete.)

## I. The right time to improve

The right time to improve---to learn how to be more efficient---is once you've already started. Once you have the practical and thorough knowledge of what you're trying to change.

Once you've begun taking action, then it is easiest to implement change. Only when you're acting are you then able to apply the knowledge.

The lessons are practical---no longer theoretical.

## II. Why there are no shortcuts

If you seek wealth---whether in money, friendship, love, experiences---the only way is through providing value to the world. Ironically, the predicate of wealth is not greed but generosity.

Living a life of service is what brings you wealth.

- To have wealth in relationships, you must give love.
- To have wealth in experiences, you must spend your time.
- To have wealth in money, you must create value.

There is no shortcut. There is no something for nothing.

*There is no free lunch.*

If you're worried about starting off on the right foot, remember this:

Starting *is* a good start.

(And if you want to work smarter, focus on that after you've completed a few laps.)
