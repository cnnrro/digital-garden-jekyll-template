## I.

We are all artists, and our lives are our masterpieces.

Every day we wake and return to the sculpture we've been working on since our birth. Chisel and mallet in hand we delicately chip away at the stone in front of us, developing our piece with whatever time we have left.

Returning to where we left off, we focus on the angle of the chisel against the stone, the power we use when striking with the mallet. We note how the stone reacts to each cut and adjust our methods accordingly. We feel how smooth and refined the work under our chisel tip has become, and we are proud.

But what exactly are we creating?


## II.

Every day we go into this world of responsibilities, overwhelming information, and limited time. Our attention is vied for at every turn---so much so it's now considered a commodity.

We wake with a to-do list that only ever seems to grow. Priorities that are contradictory and insufficient. We do our best with partial knowledge of the Truth, and we carry ourselves forward---whatever direction forward may be.

To survive this deluge of distraction, we may cope by focusing only on what's directly in front of us. We look precisely, and only, at where our foot will fall next---at where our chisel is placed. And perhaps this provides comfort or safety.

But where have we been? Where are we going? Why are we here?


## III.

Every day we work on our sculpture, but many of us only look at the stone just beneath our chisel. We focus on our hands, the sensation of each strike of the mallet. We see the crisp, smooth lines being carved into our work.

But maybe we should pause for a moment. Maybe we should lean back in our chair and examine the stone outside of our narrow focus---beyond the region we are currently working.

Maybe we should even get up from our chairs and wander around the piece. Remember what we worked on ten years ago. See how it differs from the area we worked on yesterday.

Check that the entire piece is in proportion. That even if the composition has changed through the work, it's still holistic.

Perhaps some areas are far under-worked. Perhaps some areas are already polished to perfection that upon reflection don't seem to fit, and may need re-work after all.

*But we will never notice these things if we remain hyper-focused on the chisel and mallet.*


## IV.

This is why I journal.

Journaling takes me out of the moment briefly. It allows me to stop working on the sculpture, and check how the work is coming along.

While being present in every moment is a noble goal, without reflection we may quickly find ourselves working against the piece.

Creating a regular practice of journaling has had a few benefits for me:

1. Improving intention
	- Regular reflection gives me the time to remember where I'm heading, and change course if new information has been brought to light.
	- It allows me to make clear decisions for the future, and think through things in more precise ways.
2. Early detection of declining mental health
	- Journaling makes me more cognizant of my internal monologue.
	- By putting it on the page it becomes obvious when negative thought patterns are emerging, and flags the need to make a change.
	- Whether it's negative thought spirals, catastrophizing, or insecurity, a journal makes it clear that certain topics might require some attention and resolution.
3. Getting back on track after setbacks
	- Similar to the point above, journaling can also be used to address, reflect on, and find closure around certain topics that are gnawing away at you.
4. Discovering biases and false perceptions
	- Journaling allows me to evaluate new ideas and makes it clear whether they come with strong foundations, or if they've come to me through communicative osmosis.
	- It allows me to work through new thought patterns and intentionally keep or leave them.
	- When you surround yourself with falsehood it can appear as reality. Journaling allows you to break through this.
3. Memory
	- Being able to look back on events, ideas, and sources of inspiration.
	- It also reminds me just how fickle memory is, how my perception of an event changes.
	- Seeing how an idea has evolved over time informs a deeper truth about yourself.

One final note: If you're going to make a habit of journaling, do it in a method that requires external communication. Record an audio note, write on paper, type at your computer. Don't just think, communicate, even if only to yourself.

It might shock you how an idea that felt so clear in your mind was a deception. Only through communication will you notice the gaps.
