  I believe that to live an intentional life, you must be self-reflective.

  And I find writing to be the deepest form of reflection possible.

Why bother?

At this point, I can confidently say I write more than the average person. In any given week, I spend a significant portion of time collecting thoughts, writing them out, editing them to the bone, and publishing them.

This is time I could be spending on anything---time that I will never get back.

*Why do it?*


## I. Clarity of thinking

How vivid are your ideas?

Are they vivid, or is their purity fooling you into believing they're more composed than they really are?

It's easy to fool yourself when you haven't written something down---to believe you know something when you don't.

When our ideas are left in our minds, whether they're theories of life, plans for the future, or reflections on an argument we had a year ago, they tend to appear perfect. Before we communicate an idea, whether through composition on the page or speaking to a friend, it's as if our mind is holding only the platonic ideal of the idea.

The idea represents itself as a perfect sphere, an abstract ideal that only when described in physical reality---when brought to life---will show its imperfections.

To clarify, *those imperfections were always there.* But only through the communication of the abstract idea into reality will you be able to observe them.

And only once you've observed the imperfections can you begin to improve upon them.


## II. My past self

Often I write as if I were speaking to, or put more accurately, pleading with my past self.

While I'm happy with my life, I've made my fair share of mistakes in life, and writing helps to address and learn from these mistakes.

Reflection through writing can help put the past to rest and help one grow from their regrets. Not to mention, if what I write can help even one kindred spirit avoid my mistakes, it'll all have been worth it.

Putting my thoughts to page enforces advice that I would be willing to give to others---and reminds me to take it myself.

## III. In short

I believe that to live an intentional life, you must be self-reflective.

And I find writing to be the deepest form of reflection possible.
