excerpt: Why heroes never come from comfort, and what we must all do to become heroes of our own personal story.

When does your story begin?

---

Most of us are in a steady-state. We have our routines, we feel secure. We have an understanding of the world around us and our place within it. And, for many, that is enough.

But others feel a desire for something different, something new.

*They want their life to change.*

But what changes one's life?

---

According to the narrative structure known as *The Hero's Journey,* the answer to this question lies in "the call to adventure," the opening plot point which sees our hero's normal life disturbed by a call to head into the unknown.

This is how the story begins. This is how the hero's life becomes irrevocably changed. The beginning of it all lies entirely out of our hero's hands---they are *called* into the unknown. An *external* force jolts them from normalcy.

But, the truth is, this isn't how real life usually works. *Rarely do we ever get that call.*[^1]

Like the hero, we exist in a situation of normalcy. Unlike the hero, we're destined to live that way for our entire lives---***unless we call upon ourselves.***

---

But why is it that we struggle to call upon ourselves?

We have a desire, the path may even be known to us, yet we never take that first step.

Why?

The Hero's Journey has an answer for this as well. Right after the call is another plot point, this one referred to as "refusal of the call."

Before the call, the hero is living a comfortable life, and this adventure into the unknown represents not only a great change but often great discomfort. If you've ever watched a movie you know that heroes rarely ever make it to the end unscathed. Usually, they'll have changed for the better, but not without great stress, pain, and tragedy.

And like these stories, this remains true for real life. Most callings in life require some discomfort. The most extraordinary lives are not without pain.

---

But, unlike the hero, we are not called upon, and so we wait in our comfort for our hand to be forced. We are taught that a bird in the hand is worth two in the bush, and so we settle for our lives of normalcy eschewing the possible adventure that lies before us.

*Choosing to walk a bed of coals is made harder from the comfort of a bed of silk.*

We must accept that it's unlikely our hand will ever be forced. And so we must call upon ourselves. And only when our desire outweighs our fear can we take that first step.

---

Our life is nothing more than the stories we tell ourselves.

In stories, the hero is often forced into discomfort---forced into a situation that will change their life forever. In reality, this is rare. More often than not it's up to us to make the tough decision and be the creator of our own story---to spur ourselves into discomfort, trusting that we'll make it to the other side.

Maybe then the question to ask is not "When does your story begin?" but instead ***when will you begin your story?***

I'll leave you with one final thought---a nice story to tell ourselves:

[^1]: There certainly are many life-altering events that are outside of our control, but usually, these are not calls to adventure.
