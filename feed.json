Becoming hyper-focused on yourself and hyper-critical of yourself can quickly lead to negative thought spirals and a distorted view of yourself and the world around you.</p>\n\n<p><em>If self-development is a passion, then we need to have the tools to maintain it long-term.</em></p>\n\n<h2 id=\"i-the-problem-of-self-focus\">I. The problem of self-focus<a href=\"#i-the-problem-of-self-focus\" class=\"anchor\" aria-hidden=\"true\">§</a>\n</h2>\n\n<p>If you are self-reflective, if you journal, if you consider your actions in-moment, you will end up spending a lot of time thinking about yourself. This sort of observation is needed to get a better understanding of ourselves. But, it does come with risk.</p>\n\n<p>If you focus so thoroughly and constantly on yourself, you start to make yourself the center of your own universe.</p>\n\n<p>The reality is you are a member of various tribes. You are a person within communities. But, you may start to see everything else only in relationship to yourself—you become the center of the universe.</p>\n\n<p>With this mentality, actions others take may be viewed through a false lens. You might see simple actions as slights or feel that your reactions are the intentions of others. You may lose focus that everything comes down to interaction—the interplay between multiple people—and that others are not as focused on you as you are on yourself.</p>\n\n<p>Remember that everyone has motivations, passions, desires. That we are all acting to our interests the best that we can. Imagine yourself in the shoes of others, rebuild your empathy, and see yourself as a part of the whole rather than the center of it.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"ii-hyper-criticality\">II. Hyper-criticality<a href=\"#ii-hyper-criticality\" class=\"anchor\" aria-hidden=\"true\">§</a>\n</h2>\n\n<p>Like Hank Green says regarding creative productivity<sup id=\"fnref:1\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:1\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">1</a></sup>. When you are creating something, “you are gonna know the thing you create better than anyone else will ever know it.”</p>\n\n<p>No one will know what it could have been, what you wanted it to be, the flaws that you still see within it. Everyone else will see it as a finished product, they take it as a whole, and only the most critical will seek out flaws or missed potential.</p>\n\n<p>Only you will continue to look at it knowing what you would have done next and where you think you made a mistake.</p>\n\n<p>I would imagine even artists with their work in MOMA see a brushstroke they would like to alter right then and there whenever they visit their work.</p>\n\n<p>What happens when instead of a creative piece, you apply that same critical lens—that same developmental lens—to yourself?</p>\n\n<p>This intensely focused self-awareness and overly critical thinking can lead one to focus on all the negatives—all the things they are working to improve. While this may be useful for determining next steps, it can be detrimental to living life.</p>\n\n<p>These thoughts continually polluting your mind can quickly lead to negative thought patterns, feelings of worthlessness or helplessness, an overall lowering of self-esteem.</p>\n\n<p>If self-focus may cause a distorted view of your place in your community, self-criticism may lead to a distorted view of your true value.</p>\n\n<p>If you are trying to develop yourself, if you practice journaling, conscious self-reflection, or anything else that brings a critical lens to your being, you should also practice self-forgiveness, self-acceptance, and gratitude. You should spend some time celebrating your wins, the things you and others value about yourself, and the things you are thankful for. Focus on the whole of yourself. Not just the areas you are working on.</p>\n\n<p><em>Balance the critical and the complimentary.</em></p>\n\n<p>This can give you the strength you need to be happy while allowing you to successfully develop.</p>\n\n<p><em>As much as you focus on who you want to be, you ought to remember the good things about who you already are.</em></p>\n\n<h2 id=\"iii-final-words\">III. Final words<a href=\"#iii-final-words\" class=\"anchor\" aria-hidden=\"true\">§</a>\n</h2>\n\n<p>Remember to be empathetic towards others and understanding of your place in your community.</p>\n\n<p>Remember that what you feel may not reflect reality and that you must observe yourself as a whole, not only the aspects you are working to change.</p>\n\n<p><em>Be kind to yourself.</em> Lasting change comes from a place of love.</p>\n\n<div class=\"footnotes\" role=\"doc-endnotes\">\n  <ol>\n    <li id=\"fn:1\" role=\"doc-endnote\">\n      <p><a href=\"https://youtu.be/1LAhHDEtTD0?t=170\">The Secret to my Productivity</a> <a href=\"#fnref:1\" class=\"reversefootnote\" role=\"doc-backlink\">↩</a></p>\n    </li>\n  </ol>\n</div>\n</body></html>\n",

To be intentional with these two abilities is what it means to live.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"i-decision\">I. Decision<a href=\"#i-decision\" class=\"anchor\" aria-hidden=\"true\">§</a>\n</h2>\n\n<p>We decide how we spend our time. Even right now, reading this post is a decision you are making. Are you being deliberate with that decision?</p>\n\n<p>Pause for a moment and decide if you think reading the rest of this post will be valuable for you—if it will improve your life.</p>\n\n<p><em>Be intentional.</em></p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>Making that decision is the first principle of intentional living. To be certain in the decisions you are making—how you spend your time.</p>\n\n<p>Decision leads to taking deliberate action. Being deliberate with actions will give you great conviction and confidence in how you are spending your time.</p>\n\n<p>Through this practice, you will always have a clear answer to the question “Why?”</p>\n\n<p>You might make mistakes—some decisions will turn out to be wrong—but nonetheless, you act with conviction.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>What does it feel like when we’re not being deliberate in our decisions?</p>\n\n<p>It feels like living life on autopilot—not being conscious of our actions, merely coasting. It feels like being an observer of our own lives. A side-kick to someone else’s protagonist.</p>\n\n<p>Without deliberate decision, we are living our lives in the passenger seat.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"ii-presence\">II. Presence<a href=\"#ii-presence\" class=\"anchor\" aria-hidden=\"true\">§</a>\n</h2>\n\n<p>Since you’ve started reading this, have any questions come to mind?</p>\n\n<p>Are you thinking about an email you need to respond to? A birthday that’s coming up? Are you really focusing on these words, reflecting on them, and integrating them into your perspective? Or, are you distracted or consuming without consideration?</p>\n\n<p>Take a breath. Take a moment to write down all those thoughts that are polluting your mind. All those things you’re afraid to forget.</p>\n\n<p>Take another breath. Make sure that you are engaging with these words. When we consume without consideration we experience only a fraction of what life can provide us.</p>\n\n<p>Clear your mind and focus on the action you’re taking—on the decision you’ve made.</p>\n\n<p>Try to read the rest of this without distraction. Be present.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>Once you have made a decision, you must now observe it.</p>\n\n<p>With strong enough confidence in your decision you should feel no doubts, and with no doubts polluting your mind you can focus entirely on the moment at hand. Enjoy it.</p>\n\n<p>You should aim to be mindful. Present. Conscious.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>What does it feel like when we’re not being present in the moment?</p>\n\n<p>It feels like wading through muck. Like our mind is being polluted and we’re being bogged down. It can feel manic, or it can feel overly relaxed.</p>\n\n<p>Sometimes we can hardly focus because we are so distracted by other thoughts.</p>\n\n<p>Sometimes we can hardly focus because we are consuming without consideration—our brains are shut off.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"iii-when-all-is-right\">III. When all is right<a href=\"#iii-when-all-is-right\" class=\"anchor\" aria-hidden=\"true\">§</a>\n</h2>\n\n<p>What does it feel like when these two aspects are in harmony?</p>\n\n<p><em>Flow.</em></p>\n\n<p>You should feel accepting of yourself and those things outside of your control. You should feel confident in the decisions you are making. You should feel like you are doing what you’re meant to be doing. And you should feel focused in the moment.</p>\n\n<p>This state is hard to maintain over long periods. Our minds have the tendency to fall into routine—stability. We have the tendency to avoid the overhead of being present in our decisions and actions.</p>\n\n<p>The first step is being aware when we’ve fallen back into unconscious experience.</p>\n\n<p>Once we’ve mastered that we can focus on engaging with this world in a far more intentional manner.</p>\n</body></html>\n",

            "content_html": "<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC \"-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN\" \"http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd\">\n<html><body>\n<p>Recently, I hit publish on a tweet:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Opportunity does not exist in a vacuum.</p>\n\n  <p>- <a href=\"https://twitter.com/connorjrobbins/status/1398658393531953154\">@connorjrobbins</a></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/TruthOfSigns/status/1398716947756376069\">@TruthOfSigns</a> was curious to hear more, so I decided to take down some thoughts.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>First, what did I mean by this?</p>\n\n<p>I think many people are attracted to the idea of solitary success. They want to lock themselves up in their <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Menlo_Park,_New_Jersey\">Menlo Lab</a> and come out with an invention that will change the world.</p>\n\n<p>Perhaps they won’t tell anyone where they are or what they are working on due to a <a href=\"https://www.connorjrobbins.com/blog/fear-of-failure\">fear of failure</a> or an ego-driven desire to shock and awe people once they’ve finished.</p>\n\n<p>I’d argue this is the wrong approach. While solitary deep work is necessary, it is not sufficient. And, while there is nothing inherently wrong with leading a solitary existence, <strong>extraordinary things rarely happen to those who work this way.</strong></p>\n\n<p>So when I say opportunity does not exist in a vacuum, I mean a few things:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>Most great successes come from a network of people.</li>\n  <li>Most opportunity comes from producing value for others.</li>\n  <li>The greatest way to increase our probability to achieve incredible things is by increasing our potential exposure to right-tail occurrences. And this is best achieved through meaningful relationships with other people.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2 id=\"i-the-myth-of-the-solitary-success\">I. The myth of the solitary success<a href=\"#i-the-myth-of-the-solitary-success\" class=\"anchor\" aria-hidden=\"true\">§</a>\n</h2>\n\n<p>When we think of extraordinary achievements, we often attribute them to a single person.</p>\n\n<p>The stories of CEOs, politicians, or athletes are often told as if through sheer determination, willpower, and discipline, they alone managed to achieve their goals. That they, and <em>they alone</em> put in the work required to achieve something truly extraordinary.</p>\n\n<p>Of course, if you read a more complete biography, it becomes clear that this isn’t the case.</p>\n\n<p>But when it comes to complex narratives, we tend to simplify. It creates a cleaner story and one that people can more easily identify with. And so we reduce or remove altogether the impact that luck and others had in their success.</p>\n\n<p>If you’re not careful, it’s easy to buy into this myth. And once you’ve bought in and shut yourself away, your chances of achieving your dreams are significantly reduced.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>Maybe the area this myth is most perpetuated is in writing.</p>\n\n<p>There’s this idea of a writer as a solitary figure. Someone that shuts the door to the world to create their magnum opus.</p>\n\n<p>But the truth for most writers is different.</p>\n\n<p>Yes, there is a lot of time spent at the desk, alone, writing. But there is also time spent reading and learning from the greats, and discussing the craft with their peers. They research and interview, they draw on experiences from their life, the perspectives of their friends. Even in the process of writing others are often involved—stories pitched and discussed, editors making suggestions.</p>\n\n<p>We like to imagine it otherwise, but very rarely is a novel the creation of a sole individual.</p>\n\n<p>Even ignoring the impact of editors, publishers, marketers, typesetters, designers, etc. a far simpler truth showing the communal nature of the creation remains:</p>\n\n<p><em>The writers that shut themselves away from experiences to have more time to write quickly finds they have nothing worth writing about.</em></p>\n\n<p>I believe this truth applies far more generally as well.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"ii-the-external-nature-of-opportunity\">II. The external nature of opportunity<a href=\"#ii-the-external-nature-of-opportunity\" class=\"anchor\" aria-hidden=\"true\">§</a>\n</h2>\n\n<p>Opportunity is simply a favorable circumstance—a chance occurrence, often something that provides us with progress or advancement of some kind.</p>\n\n<p>When we talk about opportunity, we might be talking about:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>A promotion</li>\n  <li>The chance to pitch our idea to an investor</li>\n  <li>An invitation to speak at a conference</li>\n  <li>Cancellation of plans giving us time to write</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>In essence, some chance occurrence that seems to favor our goals for personal fulfillment.</p>\n\n<p>Note that all those examples involve other people. And also, note that even in a case where we create an opportunity for ourselves, an opportunity cost exists.</p>\n\n<p>So, opportunity does not exist in a vacuum. Either it involves other people (which is very common) or, you are doing something which excludes others (and thus indirectly impacts them).</p>\n\n<p>We cannot escape the fact that we all live in communities of producers. And so, everything we do is relative to the rest.</p>\n\n<p>With this understanding, we can make the most of it.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"iii-the-nature-of-extraordinary-things\">III. The nature of extraordinary things<a href=\"#iii-the-nature-of-extraordinary-things\" class=\"anchor\" aria-hidden=\"true\">§</a>\n</h2>\n\n<p>If we want to experience something extraordinary in our lives, we must first understand that it’s unlikely. The rarer the experience, the higher proportion luck plays a role.</p>\n\n<p>At the same time, realize that even the most outlandish things are still possible, and there are ways to improve your lifetime odds.</p>\n\n<p>Imagine you have a coin to flip as many times as you like. Your goal is to get five tails in a row.</p>\n\n<p>If you flip the coin only once, you certainly won’t achieve your goal.</p>\n\n<p>If you flip the coin five times in a row, the chance that exactly those five attempts all show tails is only about <a href=\"https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=5+tails+in+a+row\">3%</a>.</p>\n\n<p>If you flip the coin one hundred times, the chance of achieving your goal of five tails in a row is about <a href=\"https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=5+consecutive+tails+in+100+flips\">81%</a>.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>Like a coin toss, opportunity can be thought of as the outcome of a probabilistic chemical reaction between at least two people.</p>\n\n<p>Every meaningful engagement you have can be thought of as a flip of a coin. Sometimes something extraordinary happening requires a certain number of matching faces to come up at once.</p>\n\n<p>Therefore, the more people we are in touch with, the closer we are with them, and the more frequently we engage with the external world, naturally the higher the probability for extraordinary experiences becomes.</p>\n\n<p>As a more concrete example—if extraordinary things happen by being in the right place at the right time, then we must find a way to be in many places, all the time.</p>\n\n<p>Then it’s a good thing you have friends in all sorts of places.</p>\n\n<p>If you’re on the mind of other people, you’re essentially in many places always. You’re then more likely to be in the right place at the right time, even if someone else is acting as the conduit.</p>\n\n<p>Likewise, you should have others on your mind at all times. A whole new sort of opportunity opens up when you can pass along something extraordinary to someone you care for.</p>\n\n<p>We all want to experience incredible things, and we should help each other do just that. Regardless, one thing is certain: Very rarely does an extraordinary opportunity arise when you’re keeping everything to yourself.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"iii-chaos-and-maximizing-tail-potential-aka-manufacturing-serendipity\">III. Chaos and maximizing tail potential (aka. manufacturing serendipity)<a href=\"#iii-chaos-and-maximizing-tail-potential-aka-manufacturing-serendipity\" class=\"anchor\" aria-hidden=\"true\">§</a>\n</h2>\n\n<p>Who do you think opportunity comes more readily to:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>Someone who craves stability, talks to the same five friends only about the same topics of interest, and keeps what they’re working on to themselves</li>\n  <li>Someone who craves novel experiences, keeps in touch with many people from various social circles and walks of life, and shares openly and honestly the ideas they have and the projects they’re working on</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The moral of the story is short:</p>\n\n<p><em>The more engaged you are with the external world, the more opportunity you will find.</em></p>\n\n<p>Increase the potential for a brilliant chemical reaction in your life.</p>\n\n<p>Think of your friends often, make a habit of reaching out to those you care about, and when an opportunity arises, think about who you might want to share it with.</p>\n\n<p>It doesn’t take a lot of time, but this kind of generosity is rare and rewarded.</p>\n\n<p><em>Spend time on your external world, and your internal world will thank you.</em></p>\n\n<h2 id=\"iv-actionable-advice\">IV. Actionable advice<a href=\"#iv-actionable-advice\" class=\"anchor\" aria-hidden=\"true\">§</a>\n</h2>\n\n<p>Make a habit of generosity.</p>\n\n<p>We aren’t alone in this universe—our achievements aren’t solitary. Help others, and you will benefit greatly, not just from the personal fulfillment that serving brings, but because others will turn to help you in kind.</p>\n\n<p>Take the time to understand what your friends seek, and do your best to help them find it.</p>\n\n<p>At first, it may be a habit you need to focus on, some time to block off once a week to think creatively about these opportunities. But soon, whenever an opportunity arises, your friends will be top of mind.</p>\n</body></html>\n",

There is suddenly the possibility of failure.</p>\n\n<p>But, this stress is doing us no good. At best, it will be a nagging fear in the back of our mind, and at worst, it can lead to poor judgment and a greater chance of failure.</p>\n\n<p>How do we rid ourselves of this fear?</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"i-forgive-yourself\">I. Forgive yourself<a href=\"#i-forgive-yourself\" class=\"anchor\" aria-hidden=\"true\">§</a>\n</h2>\n\n<p>First, understand that you’re not alone. Fear of failure is a form of stress that just about everyone has had to face at one point or another.</p>\n\n<p>You’re not broken.</p>\n\n<p>Don’t try to outright dismiss the fear or ignore it. This will only make things worse.</p>\n\n<p>We often try to discount our emotions in various ways, to set them aside.</p>\n\n<p>“This is stupid. This project isn’t even worth worrying about. Why do I feel this way?”</p>\n\n<p>“So-and-so never seems stressed. I should be more like them and push through.”</p>\n\n<p>Accept your emotions for what they are.</p>\n\n<p><strong>You can only improve your situation if you come at it from a place of radical honesty.</strong></p>\n\n<p>Give yourself the freedom to examine without self-judgment—the freedom to experience your emotions thoroughly and accurately.

You may be competitive about it, but you wouldn’t be <em>afraid to fail.</em></p>\n\n<p>Why is that?</p>\n\n<p>Because it’s a meaningless task. It’s not something you’ve tied to your ego, it’s not something you’re worried about others judging you for, and it’s not something you perceive as having any impact on your life.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>But you’re feeling fear now, whether about a presentation, or a project, or a new business venture. So why is that?</p>\n\n<p>Examine the fear you’re feeling for a moment. Where is it coming from?</p>\n\n<p>Sometimes this fear is an indication that we are starting down a path that feels <em>meaningful</em> to us. It’s something important.</p>\n\n<p>And what better way is there to live than to spend your time on <em>meaningful experiences.</em></p>\n\n<p>So if you are feeling fear of failure, it could very well be a positive indication:</p>\n\n<p><strong>You are heading down the right path.</strong></p>\n\n<h2 id=\"iii-quelling-the-fear\">III. Quelling the fear<a href=\"#iii-quelling-the-fear\" class=\"anchor\" aria-hidden=\"true\">§</a>\n</h2>\n\n<p>The above realization may provide you some peace. But it’s unlikely to rid you of this fear altogether. (And rightfully so.)</p>\n\n<p>To further reduce this fear, try to dig further. Let’s get to the roots of it.</p>\n\n<p>Have you started a new job? Maybe this fear stems from feeling <em>you don’t yet have the skills to succeed?</em></p>\n\n<p>Are you starting a podcast? Maybe the root is a worry that <em>no one will listen?</em></p>\n\n<p>With each answer, ask yourself whether it’s something you can control.</p>\n\n<p>In the case of starting a new job, the fear that you might not yet have the skills to succeed may be rational. Likewise, it’s something you can control.</p>\n\n<p>Find peers at work that are willing to act as a mentor. Find educational resources and make a plan to work through them. Communicate openly and honestly with your team.</p>\n\n<p><em>In many cases, the act of planning alone can significantly quell anxiety.</em></p>\n\n<p>For the case of the podcast, the worry that no one will listen is rational, but it’s not something you can directly control.</p>\n\n<p>So what can you control that might improve the odds of people listening?</p>\n\n<p>Dedicate some time to brainstorm ways to get the word out. Focus your attention on the actions you <em>can</em> take that will improve the probability of success.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"iv-regardless-of-outcome\">IV. Regardless of outcome<a href=\"#iv-regardless-of-outcome\" class=\"anchor\" aria-hidden=\"true\">§</a>\n</h2>\n\n<p>When you focus on what you have control over, you stop being a dreamer and a worrier. Instead, you become someone taking action—someone that is actively altering outcomes.</p>\n\n<p>You’ll be able to focus on education and actions—elements that will make you a better person, improving the likelihood of success for not just this dream, but every dream that follows it.</p>\n\n<p>Regardless of what happens, working on this goal will have a real and meaningful effect on you.</p>\n\n<p><strong><em>Focus on the right things. Even in failure, you’ll succeed.</em></strong></p>\n\n<h2 id=\"v-in-short\">V.

This holds especially true in the common words of wisdom we hear.</p>\n\n<p>It seems for every piece of wisdom someone preaches, someone else preaches the exact opposite.</p>\n\n<p>But does this mean that these ideas are opposed? Irreconcilable?</p>\n\n<p>Must we pick one or the other?</p>\n\n<p>Take these two common pieces of advice:</p>\n\n<ol>\n  <li>Don’t sweat the small stuff</li>\n  <li>The Devil is in the detail</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Are they really as opposed as they appear at first glance?</p>\n\n<p>Let’s see.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"i-dont-sweat-the-small-stuff\">I. Don’t sweat the small stuff<a href=\"#i-dont-sweat-the-small-stuff\" class=\"anchor\" aria-hidden=\"true\">§</a>\n</h2>\n\n<p>We often hear: Remember to <strong>zoom out.</strong> Keep an eye on the <strong>big picture.</strong> Focus on the <strong>vision.</strong> Don’t lose the forest for the trees.</p>\n\n<p>In essence, <em>don’t sweat the small stuff.</em></p>\n\n<p>We hear echoes of this mantra in other recommendations like the Pareto principle, the 80/20 rule. Don’t worry about that 80%, it doesn’t provide much value. Those details don’t matter.</p>\n\n<p>With this in mind, it’s easy to turn away from the details in favor of grander brush strokes.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"ii-the-devil-is-in-the-details\">II. The Devil is in the details<a href=\"#ii-the-devil-is-in-the-details\" class=\"anchor\" aria-hidden=\"true\">§</a>\n</h2>\n\n<p>Sometimes the smallest detail missed is all it takes for a project to crumble.</p>\n\n<p>Not only is there often a great risk in the detail, but it’s also where you can find great value.</p>\n\n<p>Don’t avoid the details, don’t shrug either the responsibility or the potential value. Instead, practice deep work, dig in, find something that no one has found before, that no one had given the requisite focus to find.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"iii-the-contradiction\">III. The contradiction<a href=\"#iii-the-contradiction\" class=\"anchor\" aria-hidden=\"true\">§</a>\n</h2>\n\n<p>Do I focus on the details or not?</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"iv-the-synthesis\">IV. The synthesis<a href=\"#iv-the-synthesis\" class=\"anchor\" aria-hidden=\"true\">§</a>\n</h2>\n\n<p>Like most advice, it’s likely the one that you feel opposed to that you should take.</p>\n\n<p>Are you the type of person that focuses on the big picture? That ignores the potential value that can come from grinding in the details? “The Devil is in the detail” is for you.</p>\n\n<p>So you get caught up in the small things? Go down rabbit holes? Are you a perfectionist who has trouble pressing “publish”? “Don’t sweat the small stuff” is for you.</p>\n\n<p>Understand your personality, what methodology you are biased towards, and try to find value in a counter-intuitive (to you) view.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>Looking just a little further, we can also see how these ideas may hint at a more fruitful recommendation:</p>\n\n<p><em>Focus on the right details.</em></p>\n\n<p>Set targets without sweating the small stuff. Execute work checking for the Devil in the detail.</p>\n\n<p>Before you begin your work, ask yourself “What am I hoping to achieve?” Begin only when you’ve reached an answer. Then while you work on the details, always keep that outcome in mind. Never stray too far from the original intention.</p>\n</body></html>\n",

If you’re a writer it may be some flash fiction or articles you’ve written. Even someone as unlikely to have a portfolio as an accountant may publish their thoughts on how IFRS will impact the particular industry they’re most expert at.</p>\n\n<p>No matter what your career, by-work, or passions may be, I am certain there is a way you can compile some records that act as a publicly available portfolio. (Or at the very least, a portfolio you’ll be able to show on request.)</p>\n\n<p>If this concept in general interests you, I would recommend checking out <a href=\"https://perell.com/\">David Perell</a> who is a known proponent of writing as a means of career development.</p>\n\n<p>Here are some reasons why, regardless of who you are, you should have a portfolio.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"i-the-immediate-value-of-starting\">I. The immediate value of starting<a href=\"#i-the-immediate-value-of-starting\" class=\"anchor\" aria-hidden=\"true\">§</a>\n</h2>\n\n<p>Starting something isn’t hard. And yet most people never do it.</p>\n\n<p>You can go from having zero online presence to having a blog online in less than 20 minutes and for no money down. And yet, there is a large group of people who say “someday I’ll sit down and start that blog.”</p>\n\n<p>Again, for most things, starting isn’t hard.</p>\n\n<p><em>And yet, most people never start.</em></p>\n\n<p>This means if you do start it’s an immediate signal.</p>\n\n<p>Doing work that wasn’t asked of you is an indication others cannot ignore.</p>\n\n<p>Once you’ve begun, even if you feel you haven’t yet achieved anything, the mere act of starting is a major indicator for others.</p>\n\n<p>Don’t believe me? Imagine for a moment that you’re a relatively successful musician and you open up Twitter to see these two DMs.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>“Hey, <strong>I have a podcast</strong> where every week we interview a new musician in the NYC area. We’d love to have you on.

Soon enough he was rubbing elbows with some big shots and eventually he was engaged in a conversation with the head of a major network.</p>\n\n<p>He had done it.</p>\n\n<p>He had done what most screenwriters only ever hope to achieve. Here he was talking to someone that had the money, and the decision making ability, to turn a script into a movie.</p>\n\n<p>And so this exec asked him “Do you have anything I could read?”</p>\n\n<p>…</p>\n\n<p><em>He hadn’t finished a script.</em></p>\n\n<p>The only thing worse than being caught red-handed is being caught empty-handed.</p>\n\n<p>We often spend so much time focusing on how to optimize our path to success that we forget one minor detail: Doing the work.</p>\n\n<p>Having a portfolio enforces that detail. To have a portfolio, you need to have done the work to bring it into existence.</p>\n\n<p>It’s obvious, but if you plan to network, if you plan to make partnerships, then it’s in your best interest to <em>be prepared.</em></p>\n\n<p>As <a href=\"https://twitter.com/shl\">Sahil</a> would say:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Let your work network for you, then let your network work for you.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Next time you find yourself in the same room as someone that can help take you to the next level, <em>make sure you have a script they can read.</em></p>\n</body></html>\n",

That it’s easy to miss the actions for the outcomes.</p>\n\n<p>James’s comment made me consider two additional points.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"i-what-is-the-true-root-of-our-desire\">I. What is the <em>true</em> root of our desire?<a href=\"#i-what-is-the-true-root-of-our-desire\" class=\"anchor\" aria-hidden=\"true\">§</a>\n</h2>\n\n<p>Many of us have some idea of what we want—we may have even written it on a Post-it note on our desk. But have we given that sticky piece of paper the reflection it deserves?</p>\n\n<p>Let’s take an example.</p>\n\n<p>Many people may say they want to “start a business.” But why do they want to start a business? “To get rich.”</p>\n\n<p>But why do you want to “get rich?” “So I can have more freedom” And why do you want “more freedom?” “So I can travel the world.”</p>\n\n<p>We could take this train of thought further until we get to the true root of the desire. But let’s assume that traveling the world is this imaginary person’s true desire.</p>\n\n<p>Suddenly we realize that what we thought was our desire (starting a business) was only a hurdle we placed in front of ourselves. Now that we understand the root of our desires (to travel) we can see more clearly what needs to be done. Perhaps we have no interest in business, but we’re more than able to learn about traveling cheaply, we’re more than able to apply for remote work opportunities, we’re more than able to learn how to make the most of our time so we can start learning new languages.</p>\n\n<p>Our desire may be far more achievable than we thought.</p>\n\n<p>Learning the root of your desire opens you up to opportunities you wouldn’t otherwise see. You’ll realize you can avoid the hurdles you placed before yourself simply by walking off the track—you had no desire to be a hurdle jumper to begin with.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"ii-do-we-have-more-control-than-we-realize\">II. Do we have more control than we realize?<a href=\"#ii-do-we-have-more-control-than-we-realize\" class=\"anchor\" aria-hidden=\"true\">§</a>\n</h2>\n\n<p>Next, in some cases, we may find we have more control than we expected.</p>\n\n<p>Packing our things and buying a plane ticket are far more controlled operations than trying to start a business.</p>\n\n<p>Or, as James mentioned in his tweet, if your true desire is freedom, you may find you can make great strides from within. While externals may improve your freedom, there are many aspects to it based upon mindset alone—something fully within your grasp.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>Find the roots of your desire. Ask yourself five consecutive “whys” or as many as it takes to reach some circular reasoning.</p>\n\n<p>You may find what you desire to be a short walk away—just a few steps off the track.</p>\n</body></html>\n",

They require more than just time at a desk, but instead long-term dedication. Daily practice. Consistency.</p>\n\n<p>One thing I wish I had learned much younger is that achievement comes—certainly—from consistent effort over a long period. It is that simple.</p>\n\n<p>It’s easy to believe that exponential growth is right around the corner. Or that we can make up for lost time later through extra effort. But these are generally not true. Even cases where these beliefs do come true are more a matter of luck than strategy—those cases cannot be optimized for.</p>\n\n<p>And so, many things are more honestly measured in days, not hours. While the hours are still important, it’s often more important that you spent many days working, even if for each day it was only twenty minutes.</p>\n\n<p>While deep work is crucial in its own right, I’d argue that consistent work serves as a greater foundation. Deep work can be added once consistency is reached.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"i-the-lives-of-writers\">I. The lives of writers<a href=\"#i-the-lives-of-writers\" class=\"anchor\" aria-hidden=\"true\">§</a>\n</h2>\n\n<p>If you study the working lives of writers you’ll find they nearly all have two things in common:</p>\n\n<ol>\n  <li>They spend fewer hours per day writing than you might expect (2-4).</li>\n  <li>They spend more days per year writing than you might expect (nearly every day).</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>I believe—whether knowingly or not—this comes from an understanding of a simple creative concept:</p>\n\n<p><em>Certain things in life take days, not hours.</em></p>\n\n<p>That is, some things that can only be estimated in days to completion because there is a limit to how many hours you can work before you need to recharge.</p>\n\n<p>Writing is one of these things.</p>\n\n<p>Writing takes a great deal of creative energy. For most people, even many of the greatest writers in history, this energy exhausts after four hours of work.</p>\n\n<p>Each day they are granted four hours of meaningful work. Those four hours either get used, or are lost. There is not saving them up for later.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"ii-simple-advice\">II. Simple advice<a href=\"#ii-simple-advice\" class=\"anchor\" aria-hidden=\"true\">§</a>\n</h2>\n\n<p>All this to say, if you are trying to take something seriously, the one thing you should keep in mind above all else is: Be consistent. Work at it every day.</p>\n\n<p>Understand that there is no making up for lost time. There is no saving your energy for a later day. The sooner you get started the further you’ll be able to go.</p>\n\n<p>Have the patience to understand it will take time. Have the discipline to put in the hours <strong>each day</strong> to make it happen.</p>\n\n<p><em>It takes days, not hours.</em></p>\n</body></html>\n",

The object of our desire<a href=\"#i-the-object-of-our-desire\" class=\"anchor\" aria-hidden=\"true\">§</a>\n</h2>\n\n<p>A lot of stress can be relieved by asking yourself the right questions.</p>\n\n<p>In a <a href=\"https://twitter.com/connorjrobbins/status/1387046630226944009\">recent tweet</a> I asked:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>What is the root of your desire?</p>\n\n  <p>Some say they want to be an entrepreneur when really what they want is to be rich. Or that they want to be an actor when really what they want is to be famous.</p>\n\n  <p>Do you want the work, or the outcome?</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>There’s a lot of pressure placed on us to succeed. Both internally and externally. We have people telling us what they expect of us, society implying who has more value than who, and we tell ourselves constantly what it is we hope to achieve.</p>\n\n<p>But what is it you hope to achieve?</p>\n\n<p>When we ask ourselves this question we may find our focus is placed on the outcome. We want financial independence, we want a promotion, we want others to understand and appreciate our art.</p>\n\n<p><em>We dream not about doing the work, but what having done the work will grant us.</em></p>\n\n<p>We claim to be passionate, but that passion is placed in our future, not in our present.</p>\n\n<p>And, most importantly, it’s placed on things outside of our control.</p>\n\n<p>Think about what you hope to achieve. How many of your answers were not entirely in your control? Winning awards, getting published, being offered a raise.</p>\n\n<p>All of the examples I’ve given so far require outside influence to go your way.</p>\n\n<p>It’s no wonder we feel stressed, so much of what we desire hinges on either chance, or the opinions of other people.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"ii-control\">II. Control<a href=\"#ii-control\" class=\"anchor\" aria-hidden=\"true\">§</a>\n</h2>\n\n<p>A core concept in Stoicism is distinguishing between what is in our control and what is not in our control.</p>\n\n<p>You might recognize this concept from the famous <em>Serenity Prayer</em> originally composed by Reinhold Niebuhr:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>God, grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change,<br>\ncourage to change the things I can,<br>\nand wisdom to know the difference.</p>\n\n  <p>- Reinhold Niebuh</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Looking back at those examples, did we have the wisdom to know the difference?</p>\n\n<p>Let’s settle our minds by focusing on the work. By focusing on the aspect of our desires that we can control.</p>\n\n<p>How many of us say that we crave financial independence, but have never looked into our finances, have never drawn up and followed a budget and savings plan?</p>\n\n<p>How many claim they want and deserve a promotion, while at the same time shirking the very step-up opportunities that would get us there with the excuse that “we’re too busy with our other tasks?”</p>\n\n<p>How many want others to appreciate our art while we struggle to put in the hours required to make art worth appreciating?</p>\n\n<p>Switch to a mindset of control. Focus on what is in your ability to change. Focus on the work and the outcome will follow.</p>\n\n<table>\n  <thead>\n    <tr>\n      <th><strong>Desire</strong></th>\n      <th><strong>Control</strong></th>\n    </tr>\n  </thead>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <td>Financial independence</td>\n      <td>Budget and save</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>Promotion at work</td>\n      <td>Prioritize step-up opportunities</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>Others to appreciate our art</td>\n      <td>Spend x hours a week creating our art</td>\n    </tr>\n  </tbody>\n</table>\n\n<h2 id=\"iii-journey\">III. Journey<a href=\"#iii-journey\" class=\"anchor\" aria-hidden=\"true\">§</a>\n</h2>\n\n<p>Focusing on the person we’ll be, the life we’ll live, once the journey concludes can be motivating. But the truth is, the journey never concludes. Which makes it clear that if we’re not enjoying the journey, there will be nothing to look forward to.</p>\n\n<p>Focusing on outcome may feel good, but it often does not inspire action. Movement will occur only when you focus on the steps.</p>\n\n<p>If you’re feeling anxiety over success train your focus on action that is in your control. Create a plan of action and watch the anxiety begin to settle.</p>\n</body></html>\n",

Eventually I picked one that fit all my possible eventual needs, but required extensive customization. After all this work I was so exhausted that I gave up.</p>\n\n<p>The second time I started writing online I decided I wouldn’t make the same mistake, instead I would just write the entire thing from scratch. You can imagine how this ended up. (Note: I did end up publishing my site online, and I’m still very proud of that work, however, it did not get me into the habit of publishing often.)</p>\n\n<p>The third time I started writing, and hopefully the last, I went with a pre-existing platform because I knew it would be good enough to start doing the <em>real work</em>—that is, to start publishing often.</p>\n\n<p>All this to say I, like many, have a bad habit of the <em>depth first search.</em> Before we can feel comfortable taking the first step, we need to be certain that it’ll be the first step of the optimal approach.</p>\n\n<p>This is not only ridiculous, it gets in your way.</p>\n\n<p>I’ve had to learn this lesson over and over, but each time it gets a little easier and I catch myself a little quicker. Now when starting a project I try to ask myself “What is the <em>true purpose?</em> What am I trying to develop?”</p>\n\n<p>Now, if your purpose is to learn about html, css, seo, open graph markup, etc. Then writing something from scratch might be the right approach. But, if your purpose is to <strong>publish writing online</strong> then all of that additional work only serves to distract.</p>\n\n<p>In this specific case the easy way out—going with a system I don’t need to think about—is what empowers me to do the real work.</p>\n\n<p>The advice I would give myself:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>Start now</li>\n  <li>Start simply</li>\n  <li>Focus on the meaningful work</li>\n  <li>Ignore everything else</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Or, otherwise put, “take the easy way out.”</p>\n</body></html>\n",
