In any given week, I spend a significant portion of time collecting thoughts, writing them out, editing them to the bone, and publishing them.</p>\n\n<p>This is time I could be spending on anything—time that I will never get back.</p>\n\n<p><em>Why do it?</em></p>\n\n<h2 id=\"i-clarity-of-thinking\">I. Clarity of thinking<a href=\"#i-clarity-of-thinking\" class=\"anchor\" aria-hidden=\"true\">§</a>\n</h2>\n\n<p>How vivid are your ideas?</p>\n\n<p>Are they vivid, or is their purity fooling you into believing they’re more composed than they really are?</p>\n\n<p>It’s easy to fool yourself when you haven’t written something down—to believe you know something when you don’t.</p>\n\n<p>When our ideas are left in our minds, whether they’re theories of life, plans for the future, or reflections on an argument we had a year ago, they tend to appear perfect. Before we communicate an idea, whether through composition on the page or speaking to a friend, it’s as if our mind is holding only the platonic ideal of the idea.</p>\n\n<p>The idea represents itself as a perfect sphere, an abstract ideal that only when described in physical reality—when brought to life—will show its imperfections.</p>\n\n<p>To clarify, <em>those imperfections were always there.</em> But only through the communication of the abstract idea into reality will you be able to observe them.</p>\n\n<p>And only once you’ve observed the imperfections can you begin to improve upon them.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"ii-my-past-self\">II. My past self<a href=\"#ii-my-past-self\" class=\"anchor\" aria-hidden=\"true\">§</a>\n</h2>\n\n<p>Often I write as if I were speaking to, or put more accurately, pleading with my past self.</p>\n\n<p>While I’m happy with my life, I’ve made my fair share of mistakes in life, and writing helps to address and learn from these mistakes.</p>\n\n<p>Reflection through writing can help put the past to rest and help one grow from their regrets. Not to mention, if what I write can help even one kindred spirit avoid my mistakes, it’ll all have been worth it.</p>\n\n<p>Putting my thoughts to page enforces advice that I would be willing to give to others—and reminds me to take it myself.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"iii-in-short\">III.

Chisel and mallet in hand we delicately chip away at the stone in front of us, developing our piece with whatever time we have left.</p>\n\n<p>Returning to where we left off, we focus on the angle of the chisel against the stone, the power we use when striking with the mallet. We note how the stone reacts to each cut and adjust our methods accordingly. We feel how smooth and refined the work under our chisel tip has become, and we are proud.</p>\n\n<p>But what exactly are we creating?</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"ii\">II.<a href=\"#ii\" class=\"anchor\" aria-hidden=\"true\">§</a>\n</h2>\n\n<p>Every day we go into this world of responsibilities, overwhelming information, and limited time. Our attention is vied for at every turn—so much so it’s now considered a commodity.</p>\n\n<p>We wake with a to-do list that only ever seems to grow. Priorities that are contradictory and insufficient. We do our best with partial knowledge of the Truth, and we carry ourselves forward—whatever direction forward may be.</p>\n\n<p>To survive this deluge of distraction, we may cope by focusing only on what’s directly in front of us. We look precisely, and only, at where our foot will fall next—at where our chisel is placed. And perhaps this provides comfort or safety.</p>\n\n<p>But where have we been? Where are we going? Why are we here?</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"iii\">III.<a href=\"#iii\" class=\"anchor\" aria-hidden=\"true\">§</a>\n</h2>\n\n<p>Every day we work on our sculpture, but many of us only look at the stone just beneath our chisel. We focus on our hands, the sensation of each strike of the mallet. We see the crisp, smooth lines being carved into our work.</p>\n\n<p>But maybe we should pause for a moment. Maybe we should lean back in our chair and examine the stone outside of our narrow focus—beyond the region we are currently working.</p>\n\n<p>Maybe we should even get up from our chairs and wander around the piece. Remember what we worked on ten years ago. See how it differs from the area we worked on yesterday.</p>\n\n<p>Check that the entire piece is in proportion. That even if the composition has changed through the work, it’s still holistic.</p>\n\n<p>Perhaps some areas are far under-worked. Perhaps some areas are already polished to perfection that upon reflection don’t seem to fit, and may need re-work after all.</p>\n\n<p><em>But we will never notice these things if we remain hyper-focused on the chisel and mallet.</em></p>\n\n<h2 id=\"iv\">IV.<a href=\"#iv\" class=\"anchor\" aria-hidden=\"true\">§</a>\n</h2>\n\n<p>This is why I journal.</p>\n\n<p>Journaling takes me out of the moment briefly. It allows me to stop working on the sculpture, and check how the work is coming along.</p>\n\n<p>While being present in every moment is a noble goal, without reflection we may quickly find ourselves working against the piece.</p>\n\n<p>Creating a regular practice of journaling has had a few benefits for me:</p>\n\n<ol>\n  <li>Improving intention\n    <ul>\n      <li>Regular reflection gives me the time to remember where I’m heading, and change course if new information has been brought to light.</li>\n      <li>It allows me to make clear decisions for the future, and think through things in more precise ways.</li>\n    </ul>\n  </li>\n  <li>Early detection of declining mental health\n    <ul>\n      <li>Journaling makes me more cognizant of my internal monologue.</li>\n      <li>By putting it on the page it becomes obvious when negative thought patterns are emerging, and flags the need to make a change.</li>\n      <li>Whether it’s negative thought spirals, catastrophizing, or insecurity, a journal makes it clear that certain topics might require some attention and resolution.</li>\n    </ul>\n  </li>\n  <li>Getting back on track after setbacks\n    <ul>\n      <li>Similar to the point above, journaling can also be used to address, reflect on, and find closure around certain topics that are gnawing away at you.</li>\n    </ul>\n  </li>\n  <li>Discovering biases and false perceptions\n    <ul>\n      <li>Journaling allows me to evaluate new ideas and makes it clear whether they come with strong foundations, or if they’ve come to me through communicative osmosis.</li>\n      <li>It allows me to work through new thought patterns and intentionally keep or leave them.</li>\n      <li>When you surround yourself with falsehood it can appear as reality. Journaling allows you to break through this.</li>\n    </ul>\n  </li>\n  <li>Memory\n    <ul>\n      <li>Being able to look back on events, ideas, and sources of inspiration.</li>\n      <li>It also reminds me just how fickle memory is, how my perception of an event changes.</li>\n      <li>Seeing how an idea has evolved over time informs a deeper truth about yourself.</li>\n    </ul>\n  </li>\n</ol>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>One final note: If you’re going to make a habit of journaling, do it in a method that requires external communication. Record an audio note, write on paper, type at your computer. Don’t just think, communicate, even if only to yourself.</p>\n\n<p>It might shock you how an idea that felt so clear in your mind was a deception. Only through communication will you notice the gaps.</p>\n\n<!-- TODO: Link to future post \"Why I Write\" (how communicating ideas clarifies your thinking) -->\n</body></html>\n",

How the story goes<a href=\"#i-how-the-story-goes\" class=\"anchor\" aria-hidden=\"true\">§</a>\n</h2>\n\n<p>Everyone goes through highs and lows—I know I have. There are times when you feel like a failure, that nothing is going your way. Maybe it’s burnout, maybe it’s a series of unlucky occurrences, sometimes it’s as simple as it being winter. Regardless, you get stuck in a rut.</p>\n\n<p>Eventually, your executive function kicks in again, and you experience a sudden burst of energy and strategic thinking. You finally find the motivation to pull yourself out of the rut.</p>\n\n<p>You take out your notebook and start jotting down how you picture your “perfect day.” What time you’ll start waking up, what the morning routine looks like, all of those habits <em>you know</em> you should be doing but just haven’t integrated yet, the projects you want to start, and on and on. All of the planning you wish you had done years ago pours forth, and you’re happy with the picture you’ve painted on the page.</p>\n\n<p>I won’t knock this practice. Coming up with a perfect day can help us create the map with which to develop ourselves.</p>\n\n<p>The problem is that we then try to do it <strong>all at once.</strong></p>\n\n<p>I’ve done it, my friends have done it—I imagine it’s very common. In essence, you take this perfect day, this list of habits, this morning routine, and you tell yourself “Starting tomorrow, this will be the way I live.”</p>\n\n<p>Amazingly, this initial bought of motivation carries you forward for the first week, maybe two. During that time you’ll be hitting all your targets. Habits are being formed, your new sleep schedule is working out, your morning routine is making you feel incredible.</p>\n\n<p>But inevitably <em>something happens.</em></p>\n\n<p>You lose steam or something outside of your control sends you spinning.</p>\n\n<p>Before you know it you’re right back to where you were and that journal entry is hidden away in a drawer somewhere. Maybe in six months or a year, you’ll start the process all over again.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"ii-how-to-change-the-story\">II. How to change the story<a href=\"#ii-how-to-change-the-story\" class=\"anchor\" aria-hidden=\"true\">§</a>\n</h2>\n\n<p>Next time, after you draw up your perfect day, pick just one thing to focus on. Only one habit that you want to form, and do it.</p>\n\n<p>Maybe it’s journaling every night before bed, or instituting the perfect shutdown ritual. Whatever it is, focus on it, singularly, until you’ve mastered it.</p>\n\n<p>And once you’ve changed your life in that one minuscule way—<strong>do it again.</strong></p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>This concept is related to two key ideas:</p>\n\n<ol>\n  <li>We all drastically overestimate what we can do in a day and underestimate what we can do in a year.</li>\n  <li>What we achieve over our lifetime is nothing more than the sum of all our days.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>I’m going to hone in on that second point for a moment because while it may be completely obvious to some, for me it took years to grasp.</p>\n\n<p><em>What we achieve over our lifetime is nothing more than the sum of all our days.</em></p>\n\n<p>We all have fantasies about our futures. Whether it’s walking the red carpet or raising a family. I’m sure you have daydreams whether in the shower or at your desk of that future. Probably often.</p>\n\n<p>And chances are it’s a future that others before you have achieved.</p>\n\n<p><strong>It’s a fantasy that is based on another’s reality.</strong></p>\n\n<p>What does that tell us?</p>\n\n<p>It tells us that it <em>can be done.</em> It’s possible. That there is some version of you that makes all the moves necessary to get there.</p>\n\n<p>But what are those moves?</p>\n\n<p>Work backward, work from large to small. Where do you need to be in five years? One year? Six months? What is the big move you need to make? What are the smaller moves you need to make to be prepared for that opportunity?</p>\n\n<p>What do you need to do today to make sure you <a href=\"https://www.connorjrobbins.com/blog/have-a-portfolio\">have a portfolio</a> when the timing is right and the opportunity is before you?</p>\n\n<p>And at the very bottom of it all: <em>What do your days look like? What are the habits you need to support this dream?</em></p>\n\n<p><strong>Pick the most important one, and start.</strong></p>\n\n<h2 id=\"iii-how-to-make-a-habit-stick\">III.

If you want to change who you are it’s easier to do it piece by piece than all at once. Sculpting one’s self takes time, don’t rush it.</p>\n\n<p>Through this process, you’ll also receive the added benefit of personal integrity. Which I cannot stress enough.</p>\n\n<p>But, even picking one thing and doing it is tough. Here are a few pieces of advice to help you:</p>\n\n<ol>\n  <li>Begin with identity/internal motivation.\n    <ul>\n      <li>It’s a lot easier to make a daily writing habit when you consider yourself a writer.</li>\n      <li>It’s a lot easier to get to bed on time when you understand the health risks associated with sleep deprivation.</li>\n    </ul>\n  </li>\n  <li>Focus on what’s in your control.\n    <ul>\n      <li>When setting goals, whether habits or otherwise, <a href=\"https://www.connorjrobbins.com/blog/focus-on-the-work\">focus on the work</a>\n</li>\n      <li>E.g. Don’t target getting at least 10 Instagram likes every day, target posting something high quality every day.</li>\n    </ul>\n  </li>\n  <li>Don’t lie to yourself.\n    <ul>\n      <li>You may need to fail to start a habit a few times before you can do this.</li>\n      <li>Try to have a sense of what you can truly commit yourself to. You should feel 100% certain that you can achieve your goal before you say “Yes.”</li>\n    </ul>\n  </li>\n  <li>Start small\n    <ul>\n      <li>It’s easier to go bigger after success than to go smaller after failure.</li>\n      <li>E.g. Target 5 pullups a day. Once you’ve been able to do that consistently up the amount.</li>\n    </ul>\n  </li>\n  <li>Track it.\n    <ul>\n      <li>Whether it’s marking Xs on a calendar or using a habit tracker app, record the days you succeed and fail.</li>\n      <li>Make a goal from a streak length, for example, 100 days in a row.</li>\n    </ul>\n  </li>\n  <li>Find an accountability buddy.\n    <ul>\n      <li>Creating a habit with a friend is much easier than going it alone.</li>\n      <li>Every day message each other about whether they’ve completed their habit.</li>\n    </ul>\n  </li>\n  <li>Plan for hiccups\n    <ul>\n      <li>What if during your 100-day streak you take a vacation? Or get sick? What are the rules for keeping the streak running (or putting it on pause guilt-free)?</li>\n    </ul>\n  </li>\n  <li>Plan for failure\n    <ul>\n      <li>Write out a plan of action for when you miss a day.</li>\n      <li>Having a plan allows you to get back on track without having to think about it.</li>\n    </ul>\n  </li>\n</ol>\n\n<h2 id=\"iv-parting-words\">IV.

But it is much simpler than that.</p>\n\n<p>In chess, a discovered check is an attack on the king made possible by moving one piece out of the way of another.</p>\n\n<p>For example, imagine there is a knight between your queen and your opponent’s king. Moving the knight elsewhere gives the queen a clear line of sight to the king, revealing a check.</p>\n\n<p>So what does this have to do with personal development?</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"i-applying-this-to-ourselves\">I. Applying this to ourselves<a href=\"#i-applying-this-to-ourselves\" class=\"anchor\" aria-hidden=\"true\">§</a>\n</h2>\n\n<p><em>Sometimes you need to get out of your own way to unleash your potential.</em></p>\n\n<p>Imagine that the pieces you control on a chessboard represent aspects of yourself. The opponent’s pieces represent obstacles that you’ll face day-to-day. Your pieces might be beliefs you hold, habits you’ve formed, relationships you have, etc.</p>\n\n<p>So then what does it mean to move your knight out of the way of your queen?</p>\n\n<p>At first blush, you might take this metaphor to mean one should move negative aspects of ourselves out of the way of our positive aspects.</p>\n\n<p>For example, one might imagine the knight as negative beliefs about yourself, toxic relationships, negative habits like the content you consume.</p>\n\n<p>Everyone has self-limiting aspects about themselves, and the most reflective people tend to understand them and are working to change them. With some focus and introspection, it’s clear to see what aspects of yourself are holding you back. <em>Then, you only need to get rid of them.</em></p>\n\n<p>But I think with a little more reflection on this metaphor we can reach a more nuanced conclusion.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"ii-the-less-obvious-aspects\">II. The less obvious aspects<a href=\"#ii-the-less-obvious-aspects\" class=\"anchor\" aria-hidden=\"true\">§</a>\n</h2>\n\n<p>What I love about this analogy is that the knight has value.</p>\n\n<p>Unlike a bad habit or self-limiting belief, it’s not something you want to be removed from the board. But, it can sometimes hold you back from the best move nonetheless. It’s useful, but it can get in the way.</p>\n\n<p><em>And often these things which are positive, but limiting, are the most difficult to see</em></p>\n\n<p>Think about what <em>positive</em> aspects of yourself or actions that you take might nonetheless be getting in your way on occasion. Is your strict method of productivity putting a damper on your creativity? Is your adherence to time-boxing causing you to put down a task just as you got in the flow—just as you were on the edge of a breakthrough?</p>\n\n<p>These positive aspects don’t need to be habits, they can also be aspects of our personality. Consider, are you the type of person that says “yes” to everything? Are you overly amiable? Both of these may be seen as positive traits, especially by those that hold them, but really reflect for a moment: Are they holding you back?</p>\n\n<p>Take a moment to reflect on the traits and habits you believe are valuable. Then take a moment to see if there are any situations where those traits and habits might be limiting.</p>\n\n<p><em>Seek out the edge cases of your personality traits. Refine yourself.</em></p>\n\n<p>We need to remember that just because something is good for us sometimes, or even most of the time, doesn’t mean it’s the best move all the time. Coming back to chess for a moment, even though a queen is the most valuable piece on the board, bringing it out early is often considered a misplay.</p>\n\n<p><em>Even the most positive and powerful habits can be misused.</em></p>\n\n<h2 id=\"iii-parting-words\">III. Parting words<a href=\"#iii-parting-words\" class=\"anchor\" aria-hidden=\"true\">§</a>\n</h2>\n\n<p>Sometimes you need to go beyond “am I following the rules I’ve laid out for myself” and ask “are these rules getting in my way?”</p>\n\n<p>And do so without throwing it all out. Instead, get more nuanced with your system—make improvements. Don’t tear things down to the foundations because you sometimes get caught on a nail poking out of the wall.</p>\n\n<p><em>In many cases, the first step towards victory is not relentless pursuit, but getting out of your own way so you have the opportunity to do something extraordinary.</em></p>\n</body></html>\n",

This sort of observation is needed to get a better understanding of ourselves. But, it does come with risk.</p>\n\n<p>If you focus so thoroughly and constantly on yourself, you start to make yourself the center of your own universe.</p>\n\n<p>The reality is you are a member of various tribes. You are a person within communities. But, you may start to see everything else only in relationship to yourself—you become the center of the universe.</p>\n\n<p>With this mentality, actions others take may be viewed through a false lens. You might see simple actions as slights or feel that your reactions are the intentions of others. You may lose focus that everything comes down to interaction—the interplay between multiple people—and that others are not as focused on you as you are on yourself.</p>\n\n<p>Remember that everyone has motivations, passions, desires. That we are all acting to our interests the best that we can.

When you are creating something, “you are gonna know the thing you create better than anyone else will ever know it.”</p>\n\n<p>No one will know what it could have been, what you wanted it to be, the flaws that you still see within it. Everyone else will see it as a finished product, they take it as a whole, and only the most critical will seek out flaws or missed potential.</p>\n\n<p>Only you will continue to look at it knowing what you would have done next and where you think you made a mistake.</p>\n\n<p>I would imagine even artists with their work in MOMA see a brushstroke they would like to alter right then and there whenever they visit their work.</p>\n\n<p>What happens when instead of a creative piece, you apply that same critical lens—that same developmental lens—to yourself?</p>\n\n<p>This intensely focused self-awareness and overly critical thinking can lead one to focus on all the negatives—all the things they are working to improve. While this may be useful for determining next steps, it can be detrimental to living life.</p>\n\n<p>These thoughts continually polluting your mind can quickly lead to negative thought patterns, feelings of worthlessness or helplessness, an overall lowering of self-esteem.</p>\n\n<p>If self-focus may cause a distorted view of your place in your community, self-criticism may lead to a distorted view of your true value.</p>\n\n<p>If you are trying to develop yourself, if you practice journaling, conscious self-reflection, or anything else that brings a critical lens to your being, you should also practice self-forgiveness, self-acceptance, and gratitude. You should spend some time celebrating your wins, the things you and others value about yourself, and the things you are thankful for. Focus on the whole of yourself. Not just the areas you are working on.</p>\n\n<p><em>Balance the critical and the complimentary.</em></p>\n\n<p>This can give you the strength you need to be happy while allowing you to successfully develop.</p>\n\n<p><em>As much as you focus on who you want to be, you ought to remember the good things about who you already are.</em></p>\n\n<h2 id=\"iii-final-words\">III. Final words<a href=\"#iii-final-words\" class=\"anchor\" aria-hidden=\"true\">§</a>\n</h2>\n\n<p>Remember to be empathetic towards others and understanding of your place in your community.</p>\n\n<p>Remember that what you feel may not reflect reality and that you must observe yourself as a whole, not only the aspects you are working to change.</p>\n\n<p><em>Be kind to yourself.</em> Lasting change comes from a place of love.</p>\n\n<div class=\"footnotes\" role=\"doc-endnotes\">\n  <ol>\n    <li id=\"fn:1\" role=\"doc-endnote\">\n      <p><a href=\"https://youtu.be/1LAhHDEtTD0?t=170\">The Secret to my Productivity</a> <a href=\"#fnref:1\" class=\"reversefootnote\" role=\"doc-backlink\">↩</a></p>\n    </li>\n  </ol>\n</div>\n</body></html>\n",

Decision<a href=\"#i-decision\" class=\"anchor\" aria-hidden=\"true\">§</a>\n</h2>\n\n<p>We decide how we spend our time. Even right now, reading this post is a decision you are making. Are you being deliberate with that decision?</p>\n\n<p>Pause for a moment and decide if you think reading the rest of this post will be valuable for you—if it will improve your life.</p>\n\n<p><em>Be intentional.</em></p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>Making that decision is the first principle of intentional living. To be certain in the decisions you are making—how you spend your time.</p>\n\n<p>Decision leads to taking deliberate action. Being deliberate with actions will give you great conviction and confidence in how you are spending your time.</p>\n\n<p>Through this practice, you will always have a clear answer to the question “Why?”</p>\n\n<p>You might make mistakes—some decisions will turn out to be wrong—but nonetheless, you act with conviction.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>What does it feel like when we’re not being deliberate in our decisions?</p>\n\n<p>It feels like living life on autopilot—not being conscious of our actions, merely coasting. It feels like being an observer of our own lives. A side-kick to someone else’s protagonist.</p>\n\n<p>Without deliberate decision, we are living our lives in the passenger seat.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"ii-presence\">II. Presence<a href=\"#ii-presence\" class=\"anchor\" aria-hidden=\"true\">§</a>\n</h2>\n\n<p>Since you’ve started reading this, have any questions come to mind?</p>\n\n<p>Are you thinking about an email you need to respond to? A birthday that’s coming up? Are you really focusing on these words, reflecting on them, and integrating them into your perspective? Or, are you distracted or consuming without consideration?</p>\n\n<p>Take a breath. Take a moment to write down all those thoughts that are polluting your mind. All those things you’re afraid to forget.</p>\n\n<p>Take another breath. Make sure that you are engaging with these words. When we consume without consideration we experience only a fraction of what life can provide us.</p>\n\n<p>Clear your mind and focus on the action you’re taking—on the decision you’ve made.</p>\n\n<p>Try to read the rest of this without distraction. Be present.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>Once you have made a decision, you must now observe it.</p>\n\n<p>With strong enough confidence in your decision you should feel no doubts, and with no doubts polluting your mind you can focus entirely on the moment at hand. Enjoy it.</p>\n\n<p>You should aim to be mindful. Present. Conscious.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>What does it feel like when we’re not being present in the moment?</p>\n\n<p>It feels like wading through muck. Like our mind is being polluted and we’re being bogged down. It can feel manic, or it can feel overly relaxed.</p>\n\n<p>Sometimes we can hardly focus because we are so distracted by other thoughts.</p>\n\n<p>Sometimes we can hardly focus because we are consuming without consideration—our brains are shut off.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"iii-when-all-is-right\">III.

You should feel confident in the decisions you are making. You should feel like you are doing what you’re meant to be doing. And you should feel focused in the moment.</p>\n\n<p>This state is hard to maintain over long periods. Our minds have the tendency to fall into routine—stability. We have the tendency to avoid the overhead of being present in our decisions and actions.</p>\n\n<p>The first step is being aware when we’ve fallen back into unconscious experience.</p>\n\n<p>Once we’ve mastered that we can focus on engaging with this world in a far more intentional manner.</p>\n</body></html>\n",

They want to lock themselves up in their <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Menlo_Park,_New_Jersey\">Menlo Lab</a> and come out with an invention that will change the world.</p>\n\n<p>Perhaps they won’t tell anyone where they are or what they are working on due to a <a href=\"https://www.connorjrobbins.com/blog/fear-of-failure\">fear of failure</a> or an ego-driven desire to shock and awe people once they’ve finished.</p>\n\n<p>I’d argue this is the wrong approach. While solitary deep work is necessary, it is not sufficient. And, while there is nothing inherently wrong with leading a solitary existence, <strong>extraordinary things rarely happen to those who work this way.</strong></p>\n\n<p>So when I say opportunity does not exist in a vacuum, I mean a few things:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>Most great successes come from a network of people.</li>\n  <li>Most opportunity comes from producing value for others.</li>\n  <li>The greatest way to increase our probability to achieve incredible things is by increasing our potential exposure to right-tail occurrences. And this is best achieved through meaningful relationships with other people.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2 id=\"i-the-myth-of-the-solitary-success\">I. The myth of the solitary success<a href=\"#i-the-myth-of-the-solitary-success\" class=\"anchor\" aria-hidden=\"true\">§</a>\n</h2>\n\n<p>When we think of extraordinary achievements, we often attribute them to a single person.</p>\n\n<p>The stories of CEOs, politicians, or athletes are often told as if through sheer determination, willpower, and discipline, they alone managed to achieve their goals. That they, and <em>they alone</em> put in the work required to achieve something truly extraordinary.</p>\n\n<p>Of course, if you read a more complete biography, it becomes clear that this isn’t the case.</p>\n\n<p>But when it comes to complex narratives, we tend to simplify. It creates a cleaner story and one that people can more easily identify with. And so we reduce or remove altogether the impact that luck and others had in their success.</p>\n\n<p>If you’re not careful, it’s easy to buy into this myth. And once you’ve bought in and shut yourself away, your chances of achieving your dreams are significantly reduced.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>Maybe the area this myth is most perpetuated is in writing.</p>\n\n<p>There’s this idea of a writer as a solitary figure. Someone that shuts the door to the world to create their magnum opus.</p>\n\n<p>But the truth for most writers is different.</p>\n\n<p>Yes, there is a lot of time spent at the desk, alone, writing. But there is also time spent reading and learning from the greats, and discussing the craft with their peers. They research and interview, they draw on experiences from their life, the perspectives of their friends. Even in the process of writing others are often involved—stories pitched and discussed, editors making suggestions.</p>\n\n<p>We like to imagine it otherwise, but very rarely is a novel the creation of a sole individual.</p>\n\n<p>Even ignoring the impact of editors, publishers, marketers, typesetters, designers, etc. a far simpler truth showing the communal nature of the creation remains:</p>\n\n<p><em>The writers that shut themselves away from experiences to have more time to write quickly finds they have nothing worth writing about.</em></p>\n\n<p>I believe this truth applies far more generally as well.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"ii-the-external-nature-of-opportunity\">II. The external nature of opportunity<a href=\"#ii-the-external-nature-of-opportunity\" class=\"anchor\" aria-hidden=\"true\">§</a>\n</h2>\n\n<p>Opportunity is simply a favorable circumstance—a chance occurrence, often something that provides us with progress or advancement of some kind.</p>\n\n<p>When we talk about opportunity, we might be talking about:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>A promotion</li>\n  <li>The chance to pitch our idea to an investor</li>\n  <li>An invitation to speak at a conference</li>\n  <li>Cancellation of plans giving us time to write</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>In essence, some chance occurrence that seems to favor our goals for personal fulfillment.</p>\n\n<p>Note that all those examples involve other people. And also, note that even in a case where we create an opportunity for ourselves, an opportunity cost exists.</p>\n\n<p>So, opportunity does not exist in a vacuum. Either it involves other people (which is very common) or, you are doing something which excludes others (and thus indirectly impacts them).</p>\n\n<p>We cannot escape the fact that we all live in communities of producers. And so, everything we do is relative to the rest.</p>\n\n<p>With this understanding, we can make the most of it.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"iii-the-nature-of-extraordinary-things\">III. The nature of extraordinary things<a href=\"#iii-the-nature-of-extraordinary-things\" class=\"anchor\" aria-hidden=\"true\">§</a>\n</h2>\n\n<p>If we want to experience something extraordinary in our lives, we must first understand that it’s unlikely. The rarer the experience, the higher proportion luck plays a role.</p>\n\n<p>At the same time, realize that even the most outlandish things are still possible, and there are ways to improve your lifetime odds.</p>\n\n<p>Imagine you have a coin to flip as many times as you like. Your goal is to get five tails in a row.</p>\n\n<p>If you flip the coin only once, you certainly won’t achieve your goal.</p>\n\n<p>If you flip the coin five times in a row, the chance that exactly those five attempts all show tails is only about <a href=\"https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=5+tails+in+a+row\">3%</a>.</p>\n\n<p>If you flip the coin one hundred times, the chance of achieving your goal of five tails in a row is about <a href=\"https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=5+consecutive+tails+in+100+flips\">81%</a>.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>Like a coin toss, opportunity can be thought of as the outcome of a probabilistic chemical reaction between at least two people.</p>\n\n<p>Every meaningful engagement you have can be thought of as a flip of a coin. Sometimes something extraordinary happening requires a certain number of matching faces to come up at once.</p>\n\n<p>Therefore, the more people we are in touch with, the closer we are with them, and the more frequently we engage with the external world, naturally the higher the probability for extraordinary experiences becomes.</p>\n\n<p>As a more concrete example—if extraordinary things happen by being in the right place at the right time, then we must find a way to be in many places, all the time.</p>\n\n<p>Then it’s a good thing you have friends in all sorts of places.</p>\n\n<p>If you’re on the mind of other people, you’re essentially in many places always. You’re then more likely to be in the right place at the right time, even if someone else is acting as the conduit.</p>\n\n<p>Likewise, you should have others on your mind at all times. A whole new sort of opportunity opens up when you can pass along something extraordinary to someone you care for.</p>\n\n<p>We all want to experience incredible things, and we should help each other do just that. Regardless, one thing is certain: Very rarely does an extraordinary opportunity arise when you’re keeping everything to yourself.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"iii-chaos-and-maximizing-tail-potential-aka-manufacturing-serendipity\">III. Chaos and maximizing tail potential (aka. manufacturing serendipity)<a href=\"#iii-chaos-and-maximizing-tail-potential-aka-manufacturing-serendipity\" class=\"anchor\" aria-hidden=\"true\">§</a>\n</h2>\n\n<p>Who do you think opportunity comes more readily to:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>Someone who craves stability, talks to the same five friends only about the same topics of interest, and keeps what they’re working on to themselves</li>\n  <li>Someone who craves novel experiences, keeps in touch with many people from various social circles and walks of life, and shares openly and honestly the ideas they have and the projects they’re working on</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The moral of the story is short:</p>\n\n<p><em>The more engaged you are with the external world, the more opportunity you will find.</em></p>\n\n<p>Increase the potential for a brilliant chemical reaction in your life.</p>\n\n<p>Think of your friends often, make a habit of reaching out to those you care about, and when an opportunity arises, think about who you might want to share it with.</p>\n\n<p>It doesn’t take a lot of time, but this kind of generosity is rare and rewarded.</p>\n\n<p><em>Spend time on your external world, and your internal world will thank you.</em></p>\n\n<h2 id=\"iv-actionable-advice\">IV. Actionable advice<a href=\"#iv-actionable-advice\" class=\"anchor\" aria-hidden=\"true\">§</a>\n</h2>\n\n<p>Make a habit of generosity.</p>\n\n<p>We aren’t alone in this universe—our achievements aren’t solitary. Help others, and you will benefit greatly, not just from the personal fulfillment that serving brings, but because others will turn to help you in kind.</p>\n\n<p>Take the time to understand what your friends seek, and do your best to help them find it.</p>\n\n<p>At first, it may be a habit you need to focus on, some time to block off once a week to think creatively about these opportunities. But soon, whenever an opportunity arises, your friends will be top of mind.</p>\n</body></html>\n",

There is suddenly the possibility of failure.</p>\n\n<p>But, this stress is doing us no good. At best, it will be a nagging fear in the back of our mind, and at worst, it can lead to poor judgment and a greater chance of failure.</p>\n\n<p>How do we rid ourselves of this fear?</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"i-forgive-yourself\">I. Forgive yourself<a href=\"#i-forgive-yourself\" class=\"anchor\" aria-hidden=\"true\">§</a>\n</h2>\n\n<p>First, understand that you’re not alone. Fear of failure is a form of stress that just about everyone has had to face at one point or another.</p>\n\n<p>You’re not broken.</p>\n\n<p>Don’t try to outright dismiss the fear or ignore it. This will only make things worse.</p>\n\n<p>We often try to discount our emotions in various ways, to set them aside.</p>\n\n<p>“This is stupid. This project isn’t even worth worrying about. Why do I feel this way?”</p>\n\n<p>“So-and-so never seems stressed. I should be more like them and push through.”</p>\n\n<p>Accept your emotions for what they are.</p>\n\n<p><strong>You can only improve your situation if you come at it from a place of radical honesty.</strong></p>\n\n<p>Give yourself the freedom to examine without self-judgment—the freedom to experience your emotions thoroughly and accurately. Only then begin to critically examine them.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"ii-the-fear-could-be-a-positive-indication\">II. The fear could be a positive indication<a href=\"#ii-the-fear-could-be-a-positive-indication\" class=\"anchor\" aria-hidden=\"true\">§</a>\n</h2>\n\n<p>If someone challenged you to a bowling pin balancing competition, chances are you’d have no fear of failure. You may be competitive about it, but you wouldn’t be <em>afraid to fail.</em></p>\n\n<p>Why is that?</p>\n\n<p>Because it’s a meaningless task. It’s not something you’ve tied to your ego, it’s not something you’re worried about others judging you for, and it’s not something you perceive as having any impact on your life.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>But you’re feeling fear now, whether about a presentation, or a project, or a new business venture. So why is that?</p>\n\n<p>Examine the fear you’re feeling for a moment. Where is it coming from?</p>\n\n<p>Sometimes this fear is an indication that we are starting down a path that feels <em>meaningful</em> to us. It’s something important.</p>\n\n<p>And what better way is there to live than to spend your time on <em>meaningful experiences.</em></p>\n\n<p>So if you are feeling fear of failure, it could very well be a positive indication:</p>\n\n<p><strong>You are heading down the right path.</strong></p>\n\n<h2 id=\"iii-quelling-the-fear\">III. Quelling the fear<a href=\"#iii-quelling-the-fear\" class=\"anchor\" aria-hidden=\"true\">§</a>\n</h2>\n\n<p>The above realization may provide you some peace. But it’s unlikely to rid you of this fear altogether. (And rightfully so.)</p>\n\n<p>To further reduce this fear, try to dig further. Let’s get to the roots of it.</p>\n\n<p>Have you started a new job? Maybe this fear stems from feeling <em>you don’t yet have the skills to succeed?</em></p>\n\n<p>Are you starting a podcast? Maybe the root is a worry that <em>no one will listen?</em></p>\n\n<p>With each answer, ask yourself whether it’s something you can control.</p>\n\n<p>In the case of starting a new job, the fear that you might not yet have the skills to succeed may be rational. Likewise, it’s something you can control.</p>\n\n<p>Find peers at work that are willing to act as a mentor. Find educational resources and make a plan to work through them. Communicate openly and honestly with your team.</p>\n\n<p><em>In many cases, the act of planning alone can significantly quell anxiety.</em></p>\n\n<p>For the case of the podcast, the worry that no one will listen is rational, but it’s not something you can directly control.</p>\n\n<p>So what can you control that might improve the odds of people listening?</p>\n\n<p>Dedicate some time to brainstorm ways to get the word out. Focus your attention on the actions you <em>can</em> take that will improve the probability of success.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"iv-regardless-of-outcome\">IV. Regardless of outcome<a href=\"#iv-regardless-of-outcome\" class=\"anchor\" aria-hidden=\"true\">§</a>\n</h2>\n\n<p>When you focus on what you have control over, you stop being a dreamer and a worrier.

This holds especially true in the common words of wisdom we hear.</p>\n\n<p>It seems for every piece of wisdom someone preaches, someone else preaches the exact opposite.</p>\n\n<p>But does this mean that these ideas are opposed? Irreconcilable?</p>\n\n<p>Must we pick one or the other?</p>\n\n<p>Take these two common pieces of advice:</p>\n\n<ol>\n  <li>Don’t sweat the small stuff</li>\n  <li>The Devil is in the detail</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Are they really as opposed as they appear at first glance?</p>\n\n<p>Let’s see.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"i-dont-sweat-the-small-stuff\">I. Don’t sweat the small stuff<a href=\"#i-dont-sweat-the-small-stuff\" class=\"anchor\" aria-hidden=\"true\">§</a>\n</h2>\n\n<p>We often hear: Remember to <strong>zoom out.</strong> Keep an eye on the <strong>big picture.</strong> Focus on the <strong>vision.</strong> Don’t lose the forest for the trees.</p>\n\n<p>In essence, <em>don’t sweat the small stuff.</em></p>\n\n<p>We hear echoes of this mantra in other recommendations like the Pareto principle, the 80/20 rule. Don’t worry about that 80%, it doesn’t provide much value. Those details don’t matter.</p>\n\n<p>With this in mind, it’s easy to turn away from the details in favor of grander brush strokes.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"ii-the-devil-is-in-the-details\">II. The Devil is in the details<a href=\"#ii-the-devil-is-in-the-details\" class=\"anchor\" aria-hidden=\"true\">§</a>\n</h2>\n\n<p>Sometimes the smallest detail missed is all it takes for a project to crumble.</p>\n\n<p>Not only is there often a great risk in the detail, but it’s also where you can find great value.</p>\n\n<p>Don’t avoid the details, don’t shrug either the responsibility or the potential value. Instead, practice deep work, dig in, find something that no one has found before, that no one had given the requisite focus to find.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"iii-the-contradiction\">III. The contradiction<a href=\"#iii-the-contradiction\" class=\"anchor\" aria-hidden=\"true\">§</a>\n</h2>\n\n<p>Do I focus on the details or not?</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"iv-the-synthesis\">IV. The synthesis<a href=\"#iv-the-synthesis\" class=\"anchor\" aria-hidden=\"true\">§</a>\n</h2>\n\n<p>Like most advice, it’s likely the one that you feel opposed to that you should take.</p>\n\n<p>Are you the type of person that focuses on the big picture? That ignores the potential value that can come from grinding in the details? “The Devil is in the detail” is for you.</p>\n\n<p>So you get caught up in the small things? Go down rabbit holes? Are you a perfectionist who has trouble pressing “publish”? “Don’t sweat the small stuff” is for you.</p>\n\n<p>Understand your personality, what methodology you are biased towards, and try to find value in a counter-intuitive (to you) view.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>Looking just a little further, we can also see how these ideas may hint at a more fruitful recommendation:</p>\n\n<p><em>Focus on the right details.</em></p>\n\n<p>Set targets without sweating the small stuff. Execute work checking for the Devil in the detail.</p>\n\n<p>Before you begin your work, ask yourself “What am I hoping to achieve?” Begin only when you’ve reached an answer. Then while you work on the details, always keep that outcome in mind. Never stray too far from the original intention.</p>\n</body></html>\n",

But I mean portfolio in a more general sense of the word. Any body of publicly available work can be considered a portfolio.</p>\n\n<p>If you’re a data scientist it may be some models you’ve created and the analysis write-up that goes along with it. If you’re a writer it may be some flash fiction or articles you’ve written. Even someone as unlikely to have a portfolio as an accountant may publish their thoughts on how IFRS will impact the particular industry they’re most expert at.</p>\n\n<p>No matter what your career, by-work, or passions may be, I am certain there is a way you can compile some records that act as a publicly available portfolio. (Or at the very least, a portfolio you’ll be able to show on request.)</p>\n\n<p>If this concept in general interests you, I would recommend checking out <a href=\"https://perell.com/\">David Perell</a> who is a known proponent of writing as a means of career development.</p>\n\n<p>Here are some reasons why, regardless of who you are, you should have a portfolio.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"i-the-immediate-value-of-starting\">I. The immediate value of starting<a href=\"#i-the-immediate-value-of-starting\" class=\"anchor\" aria-hidden=\"true\">§</a>\n</h2>\n\n<p>Starting something isn’t hard. And yet most people never do it.</p>\n\n<p>You can go from having zero online presence to having a blog online in less than 20 minutes and for no money down. And yet, there is a large group of people who say “someday I’ll sit down and start that blog.”</p>\n\n<p>Again, for most things, starting isn’t hard.</p>\n\n<p><em>And yet, most people never start.</em></p>\n\n<p>This means if you do start it’s an immediate signal.</p>\n\n<p>Doing work that wasn’t asked of you is an indication others cannot ignore.</p>\n\n<p>Once you’ve begun, even if you feel you haven’t yet achieved anything, the mere act of starting is a major indicator for others.</p>\n\n<p>Don’t believe me? Imagine for a moment that you’re a relatively successful musician and you open up Twitter to see these two DMs.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>“Hey, <strong>I have a podcast</strong> where every week we interview a new musician in the NYC area. We’d love to have you on. Are you available to chat next Tuesday at …”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>“Hey, <strong>I’m planning on starting a podcast</strong> in the next 6 months where we interview a new musician in the …”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Which of those two is going to get a response?</p>\n\n<p>(Or, at the very least, merit further investigation.)</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"ii-be-prepared\">II. Be prepared<a href=\"#ii-be-prepared\" class=\"anchor\" aria-hidden=\"true\">§</a>\n</h2>\n\n<p>A screenwriter friend of mine once talked himself into a party. Soon enough he was rubbing elbows with some big shots and eventually he was engaged in a conversation with the head of a major network.</p>\n\n<p>He had done it.</p>\n\n<p>He had done what most screenwriters only ever hope to achieve. Here he was talking to someone that had the money, and the decision making ability, to turn a script into a movie.</p>\n\n<p>And so this exec asked him “Do you have anything I could read?”</p>\n\n<p>…</p>\n\n<p><em>He hadn’t finished a script.</em></p>\n\n<p>The only thing worse than being caught red-handed is being caught empty-handed.</p>\n\n<p>We often spend so much time focusing on how to optimize our path to success that we forget one minor detail: Doing the work.</p>\n\n<p>Having a portfolio enforces that detail. To have a portfolio, you need to have done the work to bring it into existence.</p>\n\n<p>It’s obvious, but if you plan to network, if you plan to make partnerships, then it’s in your best interest to <em>be prepared.</em></p>\n\n<p>As <a href=\"https://twitter.com/shl\">Sahil</a> would say:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Let your work network for you, then let your network work for you.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Next time you find yourself in the same room as someone that can help take you to the next level, <em>make sure you have a script they can read.</em></p>\n</body></html>\n",

Money and control help, but you reach the state solely through internal means.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>This is a brilliant point to raise in addition to my recent post <a href=\"https://www.connorjrobbins.com/focus-on-the-work\"><em>Focus on the Work</em></a>.</p>\n\n<p>In <em>Focus on the Work,</em> I write about the importance of focusing our goals on action, not achievement—on things that are intrinsically within our control.</p>\n\n<p>I discuss how it can be considered misguided to focus on “being wealthy” while missing the opportunity to focus on budgeting, saving, and investing. That it’s easy to miss the actions for the outcomes.</p>\n\n<p>James’s comment made me consider two additional points.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"i-what-is-the-true-root-of-our-desire\">I. What is the <em>true</em> root of our desire?<a href=\"#i-what-is-the-true-root-of-our-desire\" class=\"anchor\" aria-hidden=\"true\">§</a>\n</h2>\n\n<p>Many of us have some idea of what we want—we may have even written it on a Post-it note on our desk. But have we given that sticky piece of paper the reflection it deserves?</p>\n\n<p>Let’s take an example.</p>\n\n<p>Many people may say they want to “start a business.” But why do they want to start a business? “To get rich.”</p>\n\n<p>But why do you want to “get rich?” “So I can have more freedom” And why do you want “more freedom?” “So I can travel the world.”</p>\n\n<p>We could take this train of thought further until we get to the true root of the desire. But let’s assume that traveling the world is this imaginary person’s true desire.</p>\n\n<p>Suddenly we realize that what we thought was our desire (starting a business) was only a hurdle we placed in front of ourselves. Now that we understand the root of our desires (to travel) we can see more clearly what needs to be done. Perhaps we have no interest in business, but we’re more than able to learn about traveling cheaply, we’re more than able to apply for remote work opportunities, we’re more than able to learn how to make the most of our time so we can start learning new languages.</p>\n\n<p>Our desire may be far more achievable than we thought.</p>\n\n<p>Learning the root of your desire opens you up to opportunities you wouldn’t otherwise see. You’ll realize you can avoid the hurdles you placed before yourself simply by walking off the track—you had no desire to be a hurdle jumper to begin with.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"ii-do-we-have-more-control-than-we-realize\">II. Do we have more control than we realize?<a href=\"#ii-do-we-have-more-control-than-we-realize\" class=\"anchor\" aria-hidden=\"true\">§</a>\n</h2>\n\n<p>Next, in some cases, we may find we have more control than we expected.</p>\n\n<p>Packing our things and buying a plane ticket are far more controlled operations than trying to start a business.</p>\n\n<p>Or, as James mentioned in his tweet, if your true desire is freedom, you may find you can make great strides from within. While externals may improve your freedom, there are many aspects to it based upon mindset alone—something fully within your grasp.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>Find the roots of your desire. Ask yourself five consecutive “whys” or as many as it takes to reach some circular reasoning.</p>\n\n<p>You may find what you desire to be a short walk away—just a few steps off the track.</p>\n</body></html>\n",

Even cases where these beliefs do come true are more a matter of luck than strategy—those cases cannot be optimized for.</p>\n\n<p>And so, many things are more honestly measured in days, not hours. While the hours are still important, it’s often more important that you spent many days working, even if for each day it was only twenty minutes.</p>\n\n<p>While deep work is crucial in its own right, I’d argue that consistent work serves as a greater foundation. Deep work can be added once consistency is reached.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"i-the-lives-of-writers\">I. The lives of writers<a href=\"#i-the-lives-of-writers\" class=\"anchor\" aria-hidden=\"true\">§</a>\n</h2>\n\n<p>If you study the working lives of writers you’ll find they nearly all have two things in common:</p>\n\n<ol>\n  <li>They spend fewer hours per day writing than you might expect (2-4).</li>\n  <li>They spend more days per year writing than you might expect (nearly every day).</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>I believe—whether knowingly or not—this comes from an understanding of a simple creative concept:</p>\n\n<p><em>Certain things in life take days, not hours.</em></p>\n\n<p>That is, some things that can only be estimated in days to completion because there is a limit to how many hours you can work before you need to recharge.</p>\n\n<p>Writing is one of these things.</p>\n\n<p>Writing takes a great deal of creative energy. For most people, even many of the greatest writers in history, this energy exhausts after four hours of work.</p>\n\n<p>Each day they are granted four hours of meaningful work. Those four hours either get used, or are lost. There is not saving them up for later.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"ii-simple-advice\">II. Simple advice<a href=\"#ii-simple-advice\" class=\"anchor\" aria-hidden=\"true\">§</a>\n</h2>\n\n<p>All this to say, if you are trying to take something seriously, the one thing you should keep in mind above all else is: Be consistent. Work at it every day.</p>\n\n<p>Understand that there is no making up for lost time. There is no saving your energy for a later day. The sooner you get started the further you’ll be able to go.</p>\n\n<p>Have the patience to understand it will take time. Have the discipline to put in the hours <strong>each day</strong> to make it happen.</p>\n\n<p><em>It takes days, not hours.</em></p>\n</body></html>\n",

The object of our desire<a href=\"#i-the-object-of-our-desire\" class=\"anchor\" aria-hidden=\"true\">§</a>\n</h2>\n\n<p>A lot of stress can be relieved by asking yourself the right questions.</p>\n\n<p>In a <a href=\"https://twitter.com/connorjrobbins/status/1387046630226944009\">recent tweet</a> I asked:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>What is the root of your desire?</p>\n\n  <p>Some say they want to be an entrepreneur when really what they want is to be rich. Or that they want to be an actor when really what they want is to be famous.</p>\n\n  <p>Do you want the work, or the outcome?</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>There’s a lot of pressure placed on us to succeed. Both internally and externally. We have people telling us what they expect of us, society implying who has more value than who, and we tell ourselves constantly what it is we hope to achieve.</p>\n\n<p>But what is it you hope to achieve?</p>\n\n<p>When we ask ourselves this question we may find our focus is placed on the outcome. We want financial independence, we want a promotion, we want others to understand and appreciate our art.</p>\n\n<p><em>We dream not about doing the work, but what having done the work will grant us.</em></p>\n\n<p>We claim to be passionate, but that passion is placed in our future, not in our present.</p>\n\n<p>And, most importantly, it’s placed on things outside of our control.</p>\n\n<p>Think about what you hope to achieve. How many of your answers were not entirely in your control? Winning awards, getting published, being offered a raise.</p>\n\n<p>All of the examples I’ve given so far require outside influence to go your way.</p>\n\n<p>It’s no wonder we feel stressed, so much of what we desire hinges on either chance, or the opinions of other people.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"ii-control\">II. Control<a href=\"#ii-control\" class=\"anchor\" aria-hidden=\"true\">§</a>\n</h2>\n\n<p>A core concept in Stoicism is distinguishing between what is in our control and what is not in our control.</p>\n\n<p>You might recognize this concept from the famous <em>Serenity Prayer</em> originally composed by Reinhold Niebuhr:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>God, grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change,<br>\ncourage to change the things I can,<br>\nand wisdom to know the difference.</p>\n\n  <p>- Reinhold Niebuh</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Looking back at those examples, did we have the wisdom to know the difference?</p>\n\n<p>Let’s settle our minds by focusing on the work. By focusing on the aspect of our desires that we can control.</p>\n\n<p>How many of us say that we crave financial independence, but have never looked into our finances, have never drawn up and followed a budget and savings plan?</p>\n\n<p>How many claim they want and deserve a promotion, while at the same time shirking the very step-up opportunities that would get us there with the excuse that “we’re too busy with our other tasks?”</p>\n\n<p>How many want others to appreciate our art while we struggle to put in the hours required to make art worth appreciating?</p>\n\n<p>Switch to a mindset of control. Focus on what is in your ability to change. Focus on the work and the outcome will follow.</p>\n\n<table>\n  <thead>\n    <tr>\n      <th><strong>Desire</strong></th>\n      <th><strong>Control</strong></th>\n    </tr>\n  </thead>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <td>Financial independence</td>\n      <td>Budget and save</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>Promotion at work</td>\n      <td>Prioritize step-up opportunities</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>Others to appreciate our art</td>\n      <td>Spend x hours a week creating our art</td>\n    </tr>\n  </tbody>\n</table>\n\n<h2 id=\"iii-journey\">III. Journey<a href=\"#iii-journey\" class=\"anchor\" aria-hidden=\"true\">§</a>\n</h2>\n\n<p>Focusing on the person we’ll be, the life we’ll live, once the journey concludes can be motivating. But the truth is, the journey never concludes. Which makes it clear that if we’re not enjoying the journey, there will be nothing to look forward to.</p>\n\n<p>Focusing on outcome may feel good, but it often does not inspire action. Movement will occur only when you focus on the steps.</p>\n\n<p>If you’re feeling anxiety over success train your focus on action that is in your control. Create a plan of action and watch the anxiety begin to settle.</p>\n</body></html>\n",

Eventually I picked one that fit all my possible eventual needs, but required extensive customization. After all this work I was so exhausted that I gave up.</p>\n\n<p>The second time I started writing online I decided I wouldn’t make the same mistake, instead I would just write the entire thing from scratch. You can imagine how this ended up. (Note: I did end up publishing my site online, and I’m still very proud of that work, however, it did not get me into the habit of publishing often.)</p>\n\n<p>The third time I started writing, and hopefully the last, I went with a pre-existing platform because I knew it would be good enough to start doing the <em>real work</em>—that is, to start publishing often.</p>\n\n<p>All this to say I, like many, have a bad habit of the <em>depth first search.</em> Before we can feel comfortable taking the first step, we need to be certain that it’ll be the first step of the optimal approach.</p>\n\n<p>This is not only ridiculous, it gets in your way.</p>\n\n<p>I’ve had to learn this lesson over and over, but each time it gets a little easier and I catch myself a little quicker. Now when starting a project I try to ask myself “What is the <em>true purpose?</em> What am I trying to develop?”</p>\n\n<p>Now, if your purpose is to learn about html, css, seo, open graph markup, etc. Then writing something from scratch might be the right approach. But, if your purpose is to <strong>publish writing online</strong> then all of that additional work only serves to distract.</p>\n\n<p>In this specific case the easy way out—going with a system I don’t need to think about—is what empowers me to do the real work.</p>\n\n<p>The advice I would give myself:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>Start now</li>\n  <li>Start simply</li>\n  <li>Focus on the meaningful work</li>\n  <li>Ignore everything else</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Or, otherwise put, “take the easy way out.”</p>\n</body></html>\n",
