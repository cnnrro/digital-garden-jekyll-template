Some of it to sleep, some to education, entertainment, relationships, etc. In essence, it’s a watering can we use on different areas of our garden. We water what we hope to grow.<p>But there’s another dimension to time: age. In each moment we are a distinct precise age. Once that moment passes, we are never to be that age again.<p>In this way, time can be thought of as floating down a river. At each leg of the journey, for each turn the river takes, we must choose where to place our focus. Do we shut our eyes to focus on listening to the birds? Do we look up to the mountains? Look down through the surface of the water below?<p>What’s worrying is on this river ride certain experiences are only available during certain legs. Sure the mountains may always be in view, and we can focus on them whenever we choose, but that fox den you pass by at the start is the only opportunity you have to watch them playing.<p>Some people will spend the entire time on this river ride staring up at the mountains, and perhaps some of them will be perfectly content. But, I’d argue most of these mountain watchers will regret not looking for the foxes when they had the chance.<p>Even worse, many people might end up napping through the entire trip.<p>The point is, certain experiences are tied to our stages in life, and once missed they will be nothing more than nostalgia unknown.<p>If you are faced with the choice between an experience unique to your stage in life, and something you can experience at any time, I would argue pick the former.<p><em>At the very least, wake up from the nap.</em></p></article><h3>Recent posts</h3><div><div class=list-entry><div><a href=/blog/sharpen-your-axe>Sharpen Your Axe</a> <span class=faded>(2021-09-11)</span></div><div>Improving your use of time is the same as creating additional time.</div></div><div class=list-entry><div><a href=/blog/getting-out-of-a-rut>Getting out of a Rut</a> <span class=faded>(2021-09-04)</span></div><div>The method I use to get back on course.</div></div><div class=list-entry><div><a href=/blog/stillness>Stillness</a> <span class=faded>(2021-08-28)</span></div><div>My mind was empty.
