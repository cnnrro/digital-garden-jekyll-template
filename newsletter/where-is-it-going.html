Walking in strange curves, circles, occasionally retracing its steps from only moments ago.<p><em>To me, it seemed lost.</em><p>I wondered what its life must be like. How it makes its decisions.<p>So low to the ground that pillbug must only perceive what is directly in front of it. And yet, it continues to travel. What is it searching for? Food? Companionship?<p>From where I sat, far above it, I could see the path it took—the wasted steps, the seemingly confused life it led.<p><em>Where is it heading?</em><p>How can it possibly decide where to step next when it lacks all the perspective I have? How does it work with such minimal knowledge?<hr><p>I imagined myself in a field of maize—stalks that rose far above me, my perspective limited to my immediate surroundings. <em>How would I get out?</em><p>Might I be frightened?<p>Sure.<p>Would that stop me from acting? Stop me from trying my best—with the limited perspective I had—to get to the edge of the field?<p>No.<p>I would carry on. I would do all in my power to move forward—the same as anyone else.<hr><p>And then I realized I’m already in that field. We all are. Every day.<p>From the perspective of the universe, of a prime mover, of a consciousness we can imagine but cannot understand—we are no different than the pillbug.<p>Every day we take action based on limited knowledge.<p>We may understand that the road we take will lead to the grocery store, but do we know enough to predict how tomorrow will look? Five years from now?<p>How can we take action with such limited information?<p><em>How can we choose a direction to travel in a field of maize?</em><hr><p>Even considering all this: <em>I am happy.</em><p>While I watched that pillbug travel, assuming it was lost, I was enjoying the heat of the sun. I was taking solace in simple pleasure.<p>At a cosmic level, we are all lost, and yet, <em>we can find contentment.</em><p>I’m grateful.<p>While I was enjoying watching the pillbug, I like to imagine it was enjoying its life as well.</p></article><h3>Recent posts</h3><div><div class=list-entry><div><a href=/blog/perennial-regret>Perennial Regret</a> <span class=faded>(2021-08-07)</span></div><div>If we are growing, regret is destined to be present for all seasons of our lives.
